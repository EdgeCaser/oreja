It doesn't. And I didn't mean to imply it was necessary, I was just bringing it up that now that everything was going to be one system, should we reconsider it?",

Okay well but that does happen at two different stages right so the dual pool was always OGG Trump and OGG Trump so that was my I don't I guess that's the thing so maybe the part that i'm stuck on is like how are they linked how is it a compromise like aren't they just completely unrelated they i mean they are completely unrelated in the sense that that you don't need one like it was really like a fourth like it was what's the word contrived in such a way to justify having the two liquidity pools",

What will the return be? Is this thing going to net us money or not? Okay, then let's move forward like that. And then we can lower the graduation price, which is really interesting. Good. That is also another good thing. Yeah, can you follow up with Brees on that? Because I know he was worried about it.

But we spent a lot of money with them. And basically what we told them was, hey, we don't really want to pay for this at all, to be honest. Because right now we have, like, no traffic or no traffic that we're monitoring. So we essentially want to keep our data. So we're going to terminate this or you need to come back with, like plan that's you know like a thousand dollars a month max um and then the guy came back to us with like a went from like a 500k a year plan to like a 350 000 a year plan so he just thinks he's in like a regular negotiation so it didn't land so so we're serious we're like no no no really like I really am going to shut it off if we it there's literally no reason for us to be locking in 350k a year on for what we're using it for right now so um and we just don't have we don't even have the catch right now to be doing that like it's not we're not in the position we were in before so so my take is like it could be painful but we're in this weird they're always happy to take your money once you start growing and you call them and ask to work out a plan and they'll always give us the same sort of bulk discounting stuff that they're not going to penalize us for having terminated previously yeah but they're because they're a public company they're like really averse to losing um customers because shows up in their numbers. So the salespeople push really hard to just keep the contract because I guess like their job is judged partially based on churn, which creates a really weird set of incentives. And so like my plan is to really hold them to that, which is like they get us a us a contract that's, like, $1,000 a month or we just terminate.",

Yes, it's not available. All the leverage the leverage in the ui and telegram yeah and almost none of the leverage is in the ui on what we're doing now it's like the ui has to be sufficiently good but but if we're spending a bunch of time running a b tests on ui we're probably not making any progress we probably have to be innovating on the incentives like like virtuals right this is true launching data is going to be far more valuable valuable to us Right, so I'm kind of wondering how valuable it's going to be in general It's not that it doesn't have any value. It's just like it's in web 2 It's it's like 98% of your analytics value and it feels like it might end up being like 5% With where we're headed. I think it is important for us to know how many people are coming I don't know how important it is anymore to know with exhaustive detail what they are doing. Because their activity will show on the blockchain. That's right. The ultimate conversion shows on the blockchain. And it's kind of useful to know where somebody falls off in a flow. But in many cases, it less about the quality of the ui and more about just like was it compelling enough on the incentive side yeah to get them to go through the things and so yeah so that's what i just want to give you a heads up so that's if i'm comfortable going out without i mean i'm not saying we have to be naked in terms of analytics but like i'm comfortable going out going out without Amplitude and just having some like very basic tracking with Google Analytics or something like and scrapping a lot of the taxonomy and then leaning in very obviously on the blockchain side, I don't want to sacrifice anything. We need to know all the stuff around how the tokens are trading. So, but just so you know where things are sitting with them. And then if we determine we want to use it later there's nothing stopping us from just like setting up a contract and sorting it",

It's frustrating because when I met with him in the morning, he showed me a staking transaction that he had done to show that, okay, we already had that part on the front end working. He explained that there was, like it's showing in the, like the staking widget shows up in the top coins, not in the new coins. It doesn't show in the new and upcoming coins, basically because the upcoming coins, it was originally not part of that design. We were not gonna allow staking. So it just hasn't been implemented. And Kai was like, yeah, Carl's can do that in a few minutes. So I'm in that state of, well, yeah, in theory it works, but I needed to see it work and Kai's not here anymore. And it was a similar situation with when I tried to do the staking. And part of it was simply like, we're meeting and he's like, well, you know, I'm on the bus, I'm going to run. So I'm like, well, but can I do the staking? and he's like well you know i'm on the i'm on the bus i'm gonna run so i'm like well but can i do the staking and he's like yes you just have to send yourself tokens to your profile to your wallet profile which which makes sense however the the wallet the dev wallet has dozens of tokens with repeated names so it took me quite a few minutes to find a token that would be recognized and by that time Kyve had disappeared so it was like well for for all I so it was very like convenient for him to all of a sudden disappear um so Breeze has just come in and he's noticing the same things that I'm noticing and we've just been knocking him out. He's also now just been able to to finish the staking and he's starting in to vote but I'm hoping that when Carls comes in he really can fix the both the staking and finalize the the swapping on all three types of tokens.",

What we were talking about with Mark and with Carlos is maybe it behooves us to have me share some of the managing stuff that Damon is doing, because we need him coding. That's what I was thinking too, because I think when we were running the Titus Engineering was actually when you were the most involved, when I reflect on the last year and a half. I think that there's less telephone involved because you're not managing specs through another layer. Damon just has a lot, and it creates even more confusion and missed dropped balls and stuff stuff so it gets things done faster because you're in a loop and then i think like you said damon has been a bottleneck for sure um the other with the other bottleneck being kai because he's just been we keep putting everything important sequentially on his plate and that's what this week has been about is like starting to make sure that barice and car and then hopefully Santosh, everyone can touch everything so he's no longer a bottleneck. Kai can't be a bottleneck. If we solve those two problems, we solve probably like half the speed issues of the execution of the team. I think so. So yeah, so like once I have Damon here that is in my time zone and I can just really go in there and ask really like like give me 15 minutes of your time and walk me from A to C on this thing so that I can explain it that's like gonna be probably the biggest missing piece for me to be able to have more of a grip yeah and we're gonna have to see like what when Damonon coming back like what everything is is like in his world um yeah i can't yeah his his schedule is certainly gonna be different his availability will reduce so we'll have to be really smart about how we use his time yeah hopefully hopefully he's in a position where he can like get normal sleep because i feel like",

But, okay, so, look, that's, yeah, because I've been really happy with, like, all things considered, how things are going, and I feel like you have a skill set that, like, you know, that is unique on the team to actually do a good job of getting everybody organized. You know, even Damon, with his ability to understand and grasp so many things i think sometimes glosses over some of the details because if he were to do it himself he'd be able to fill them in but but we have a team that really requires like every single thing to be spelled out at the moment so um yeah i think i think it's been i've been happy with like the last few days and how that's going so i think you're right i think we should and it's it's it shouldn't be surprising because it's like how how gems went like i think you um you did a good job of getting everybody aligned and and working on shipping the thing and so that's that's where i think it makes sense for you to be spending a of your time and um yeah i am i mean more broadly like we i've uh you know like last few weeks i guess i've i've kind of internalized these the the opportunity costs of having not been out and um like i mentioned the other day you know having looked at like the numbers and then just saying like wow okay if we're out we're like probably top four or five we're we're talking about a hundred to five hundred thousand dollars a day in revenue depending on the day and whatever and just realizing the weight of that has has like amped up the the stress on my end about like feeling like we're just not making fast enough progress because once the once the um cost of not being out get that high it's like it really makes you and i don't think it's delusion i think it's it's just a the truth and in a weird way um you know we kick this thing off in febru the meme market, meme coin market, which is kind of like beginning to deflate rapidly. But I don't think it's it's necessarily that since since then, over the last four months, that like the outlook for for meme coins has changed a whole lot. I think it's changed a little bit, but not any more than we really expected. In in fact some of these big ones like trump are still they're still doing probably better than most people would have expected four months ago when things started deflating so i think that the um the thing that i've realized is that like every time some new solana launch pad or product launches they just keep kind of taking liquidity and then pumped up fun all the revenue they make and they keep in their cruiseries is um sucking liquidity out from all the solana creators and so like the longer this stuff goes on and you're not out also like the more the more liquidity begins to deflate from a particular chain chain like you get these wealth wealth creation moments like solana went up in price then people said wow okay i don't have that many games left on solana so they start gambling in the pump fun casino and then solana takes a billion dollars of liquidity out of the ecosystem which doesn't seem like that much but i think it's more than people think because so much of the trades are back and forth with low fees that a lot of it is just money shuffling around right so sometimes it seems like oh there's trillions of dollars going on in blockchain but the reality is like you can't sell all trillion dollars and get it out that's that's the market cap based on the price if everyone were able to sell at the the current prices for all the assets which is just not the case so um it's it's really hard to gauge like how much how much actual money is in is in the solana ecosystem these other ecosystems because we we look at trading volumes and it's always so impressive but like the cost to move these these this money around now is so low that you can be moving hundreds of millions of dollars like believe can do a hundred million dollars in volume in a day and it's like how does that even possible well because they're only taking you know two percent out so um it's it's like",

So, I don't feel the need to time the market with what we're doing, but we definitely don't want to go out in the trough of that.

      "text": "Let's do it. like the design is in a really interesting place and the biggest risk with it would be that it would be too conservative not too aggressive and where there's a previous one was like too too aggressive in a sense like anyone can launch any token and it's wide open or whatever right so um i guess like i'm anxious to get it out so that we put our flag in the ground because i really do think this is like a shelling point where as long as we have the coins out and the narrative out first, then all the capital flows to us and then no one else will really be able to do it. And we'll have time to sort out a lot of the details just because we won't have time. I mean, the markets move fast. And if you fuck up and you're dead to people, well, then they move on really quick within a week. But as long as we get them to believe and stay believing in the narrative and and fix the things that we need to fix then i think we have we have weeks and months to get like all the game content in and a lot of the other things that we're worried about that are big and hard a lot of those things could take time to happen and like people would be okay with it as long as price is okay so yeah that's the big if yeah and and i've started to realize that price is more dependent on the other things than even more dependent on on um some of the things that we like we're probably ahead in our thinking on a lot of the things that that um make this these real ecosystems than any of these other launchers i mean believe coin and just said, hey, there's a founder and they launch a coin and that's it. Kind of attached to their company, but there's no mechanisms. We're coming up with all these mechanisms and all this other stuff. And they had none of that. They're just like, hey, there's a thing and you launch a coin and it's attached to somebody's company and we'll figure out the rest later and um so that but i i think that that's okay like i think that that's a a good a good thing to some extent because we'll have a very credible like virtuals that'll make people look at this thing as like very credible like when people look at virtuals and all the design they've done around the thinking around the agents and the agent treasury and all this stuff they're like well there's something you know this is a real experiment with real iteration happening frequently that's driving towards some sort of outcome and i don't know if it's going to work but there's some like 10% chance or something that it does and therefore i'll price it like this because there's no one else in the world who's figuring out how like self-sovereign agents have their own wallets and is iterating every week and has all the capital flowing into them to figure it out so it's just like this probabilistic bet that some smart people are willing to make yeah and i feel like that's the position we could be in is like the best outcome is like a or not the best outcome the best outcome is it all just works very quickly and it proof is in the pudding. The second best outcome is, oh, wow, this is a really interesting concept. They're sort of halfway there on having figured out every piece, but they keep iterating and they have all the capital, like virtuals. And because every week things keep getting better, the probability on this thing working over the next year is pretty high so i'm going to park my money here that's those are the two um good outcomes so i had a i had a call with uh caps from jupiter he's kind of meows number two and um his name is real he's indian so it's k-a-s-h not cash c-a-s-h um and uh and anyway he i wanted to talk to him about doing a jupiter game coin and he's actually on board which is a big deal because i think jupiter is a top four token in solana so you know we have we have all these meme coins on board but now we have the number one coin you can get in solana that isn't solana itself is is jupiter um and they said they he's 100 they're gonna do it with us nice so so we really do we have such a such a setup here it's just kind of crazy he did have good feedback like one of the interesting things about talking to him is all these meme coins have had different sort of distribution stories um whereas like jupiter every every coin has their own story for how they did their airdrops and how it came to be and how their community was formed or whatever he had really interesting feedback on like how we should handle the claim mechanism and he's like you gotta be really careful not to call it airdrop we keep calling it airdrop but it's not an airdrop right people have to come and claim it it's true um so so he was saying like this idea of getting to a five percent threshold to be a launcher is a really good idea he thought this was very smart um but he thought that giving a broad distribution to the rest of the token holders might be a mistake to the base holders yeah so say we launch juke game coin and and then we have five points goes to the launchers and then 15 points goes to all the other juke holders there are a couple things he pointed out he said one um for the five percent of token of of the the launchers that vote he's like you got to think if it's circulating supply or total supply um and i hadn't thought a lot about that because you know for the meme coins in many cases it's the same right um but for people like them they have a ton of of lost token because when we start doing protocols there's a huge difference between between circulating supply and and total supply and he's like so i think you should make it five percent of circulating supply because in some cases five percent of total supply might be like 15 or 20 percent of all the token which is probably going to get really hard to do um so that was the first really useful point of feedback that would be like a dumb mistake to have made but just talking to somebody who had a token distribution like it's obvious once he said it but something that we didn't think about so i don't know does that make sense to you i think so yeah i mean the other thing that i think about is both many of those base coins probably have terrible guinea coefficients so like giving 15 to base coin holders how much of that is going to jump into like the top five coin holders already right like if we get 15 to trump to trump holders how much is the trump group itself getting and does it benefit us or not i don't know yeah so he said um he's not opposed to paying whales his bigger concern around the claim first of all he's like yeah airdrops are terrible because you know there's so many spam airdrops that everyone just sells everything they get in their wallet and they don't know what it is so claims are better which we're already doing but he said you should never give anyone money if you don't give them enough he said there's a very weird psychological thing that they've they've just seen with all the token launches they've done where like if you give someone money but you give them like less than ten dollars they just they they feel entitled to what you've given them because you told them they deserved it but they feel like you didn't give them enough and if you give them nothing then no one complains um so so he was saying like you need to make sure he's like you got to model out how many people can i give like at least a hundred dollars and and if i can't give them a hundred dollars and like i probably shouldn't even put them in the airdrop because what you really want to do is build an actual complaints yeah you're yeah you're creating complaints and you're not creating fans in a real community to create fans in a real community you need to make some people rich or make them a good chunk of money if you don't make them rich um and and like then they they they become very grateful and they stay as holders so he was just saying like look you might want to consider just giving even more to the people who launch the token but then the more you get to the launch of the token then the less there there is left over to give it to the rest of the token holders and it kind of begs the question like do you just give the whole thing to like launchers or something right so that was also something i i hadn't thought about that i think he's he's right about which is like say say you did do five percent threshold but then 20 of the game coin just went to those launchers like you have way fewer people that from those those token communities that got it but they'd be self-selected to be the people who took the initiative that care about the game coin are way less likely to sell and you'd make them a lot more money so they'd be much more loyal than giving them a small amount um and and then having all these other people random people who get some that don't care then they just instant but so so yeah it's like how do you he's like look people have to think about their token just like nfts you kind of have to think about it like as an art collector or an art salesperson or gallery it's like you won't just sell it to anybody you have to like you're qualifying the customer because if you you sell the the art to someone who's just going to dump it then the value of the art goes down and if you want the value of the art to go up you need to make sure just like the watch salesman people and everything else like you're only selling it to people you know won't sell so the whole token distribution thing of to your point it's unfortunate but like the whole guinea coefficient thing of like how it actually works is like a lot of times you want to give it to whales because they're just way less likely to dump and um you're giving it to people who just like famous artists want to have um billionaires hold their part because they're not going to sell it yeah and so the value can continue to go up so i don't in our case like i guess the decision point on this like i thought that was really good feedback and makes sense based on what i've heard but i don't think that we thought this part through enough and it's i guess the the point is like we should we should make a call like are we you know what price would would a token have to get to in many of the different market cap situations for these other people to get this 15% claim and be happy with it versus just like annoyed or it doesn't even make sense or they're fighting it because they're like hey this is dumb look this thing has you can go claim your $1 of this game coin, who cares why they've been doing this, right?",

      "text": "in like maybe even increase the chunk for the launchers um but yeah it's like do we do anything for for base coin holders at all like any small percentage or just zero because based on what i'm hearing it's just zero well yeah because if you increase the launchers pool like say hey look instead of five percent ten percent now you have ten percent left over for everybody else in which case the rewards become even less significant so it begs the question of like why are you giving them anything at all yeah right that's but there may be another way of qualifying holders within the the token pool that we think are high quality i just i i haven't thought of one yet so like launchers is a nice self-selecting mechanism and the bigger bag you give to the launchers the more they're on the hook to go promote it anyway and so the insight here is like hopefully five percent of the tokens or five percent of the circulating supply of tokens is pretty pretty hard threshold to get to. So you're getting enough for the community where, like, these are people who can go and move the needle. It's not easy to just get to 5%. Like, one of these large market cap tokens, like, for Jupiter to get to 5%, he thought we could do it. They get 13% average participation on their governance stuff. So he thought 5% is doable um it's going to take a lot of people coming and showing up but he's going to give us access to all the channels he's going to promote it and meow's account and jupiter's account and everything else that he thinks is just going to happen um but the point is like if if you get those people signed up and vote and voting to launch then you probably end up in a situation where if you give them a really big bag and then you put the lockup. He said the lockup idea is a very good idea that we should 100% do that, which is you get milestones based on market cap for the lockup for these people. And the bigger bag they have, the more they care about the lockup. yeah so that's the other thing is like if we just do the claim and everyone's getting like a dollar worth of stuff then no one cares about when the lock up ends right um but if we just make it all launcher pool and these guys actually have a lot of money that they can get then then they're going to have a lot of pressure to go and and promote it to everyone in their community who didn't get a free a free claim and then if maybe the optics are better if if the launchers launched it and it's enough people from the community that everybody had their fair chance to be the people who launched the game point and it's a good chunk of them because it's five percent then all the people who didn't weren't involved with it can't really complain they didn't get anything and maybe they're less likely to complain if they'd get nothing versus if they got 50 cents is an interesting insight right like if some guy makes like ten thousand dollars on launching this thing and then a bunch of other people make 50 cents they're probably like what the hell happened here but if it's just the people who took the initiative to launch the game coin make good money and then everybody else didn't get anything because they didn't help you might actually be in a much better situation psychologically so why not then give launchers a cool 10 like a full flat 10 instead of five and room and return the rest to the bonding curve we could return to the bonding curve it just or do we it's hard for me to i don't understand the trade-off of or it could go to the rewards right yeah um or it could be give the launchers even more give them 20 because at the end of the day it's like if we the bonding curve people are kind of shitheads that's kind of what we're learning right you look at all these other i mean if if you go and look at all these other protocols that are just launch pads that have launched recently what you see time and time again is you're gambling on who buys the supply first and it's often these snipers increasingly though and and they they don't add a lot of value they're just extracting and you're helping to do price discovery but if you think about like the people who are actually in a position to add value it's the people from the original community so if you if you can i don't know that's the case for just giving them 20 because basically like if you enrich a bunch of people from the juke game coin or the trump that that took the initiative to go invoke to get the thing launched then they're going to be grateful that you made them a lot of money and they're going to make sure that this is a thing that everybody in that community knows about and if you put it on an unlocked schedule where they're they're forced to pump the price because they have bigger and bigger bags um yeah i mean you you have the exact people who are in the position to promote the thing with the biggest bags whereas anyone who buys in the bonding curve is just some rando who's either got a sniper set up or whatever and then you solve the governance part too ian which is pretty interesting right like if 20 of the supply is held by by people who actually hold the the original coin and have opted in to thinking that the game coin is a good idea yeah they have a very strong interest in governing the thing properly yeah and the thing is just more legit so so yeah the more i thought about this i was like maybe the whole he's just like you always got to do smaller smaller claims and more directed um claims and so you know the drawback of this is you're going to miss a bunch of people but you're self-selecting for people who actually think this is a good idea um now there's gonna be mercenaries in there too because like once people learn how this works there's gonna be some people are just like this is a way to get a bunch of supply of a thing very easily and so you'll get people who are farming these other tokens for sure and I don't think there's really anything we can do about that like that's that's just the way the world works every system eventually gets has people that will try to exploit it yeah yeah but we're trying the point he made to me that i thought was really interesting is he's like you actually want every community should be like a little bit like different like you don't want the community for the game coin to be the same community as the base coin because most people that have the base coin don't care about the game coin but you need to figure out who the people are that care about the game coin and make sure that they're very richly rewarded so that they go do all the work or that some of them go do the work he's like it's you know it's one percent that go do the work but you make money for a hundred people and one or two of them are actually going to go out of their way to really promote the thing yeah that's and yeah so look i mean i don't know that we give it back to the bonding curve no in fact now now the argument is should we make the nest egg of like that like that um you know that little piggy bank that people are looking for would be so big like what's the number that is the optimal size of reward that gets people optimally invested it's a 10 it's a 20 it's all like am i making sense yeah it makes sense so like ego did the launch pad a few weeks ago where you can launch anybody's social profile and 50% goes to the person who owns a social profile when they claim. I don't know that we're in a situation where we want to give that much because these could end up being much bigger, I think, than any individual random social profile. So it's more about dollar value than percentage um and then i think about",

Yeah it's much better to to having missed out than to having gotten a crappy and crappy number.

I maybe we can relate it to that jump into the the stuff about the trading pairs because I I sometimes these conversations are tricky over the chat, but I was actually really I'm just trying to understand like I I, basically, I'm not to to switching it to be one liquidity goal at all um but then i was going and trying to really understand like why we had two liquidity pools in the first place because i know that we changed the way the bonding curve is quoted which i think is a really good change i think we were probably making a huge mistake that we didn't realize before not just for technical reasons but for liquidity reasons yeah with enforcing that and um quoting in seoul or og when we're live with og is a much better path um and it's just more in line with with what burples is doing which is succeeding so there's no reason to like break things that don't that already work for sure um but on the double liquidity pool side that was something we were doing that was um not typical of the other ones so we're kind of like taking on risk so by default it's like well you know maybe we shouldn't have done that in the first place because no one else is doing it but nothing changed about the way those are quoted like so i guess i didn't see why why changing the quote token for the bonding curve had any impact on changing the double equity pool for the... It doesn't. And I didn't mean to imply it was necessary, I was just bringing it up that now that everything was going to be one system, should we reconsider it? I don't have a very strong opinion one way or the other because i don't have enough data to know which one is best for us i did ask uh architect for their opinion um and i'm waiting to hear back from uh from daniel on that right yeah so i because they were weren't they kind of pushing i i never was the main proponent behind it it was you and them and they were like i for for the og token to be to be more closely tied to the uh to the whole launch pad they wanted from the beginning for it to be uh ogg trump but at the time we were very insistent on we want people to be able to buy with Trump so the compromise was this dual pool so that we could have our cake and eat it too. Okay well but that does happen at two different stages right so the dual pool was always OGG Trump and OGG Trump so that was my I don't I guess that's the thing so maybe the part that i'm stuck on is like how are they linked how is it a compromise like aren't they just completely unrelated they i mean they are completely unrelated in the sense that that you don't need one like it was really like a fourth like it was what's the word contrived in such a way to justify having the two liquidity pools oh okay okay that's all i'm making sure because like what i you know i'm not like tokenomics expert over here so what i'm trying to do is and i think that what we did is um kind of innovate in ways we shouldn't have with the the mean token pairing and and even these dual liquidity pools but i'm just trying to make sure i'm not missing anything about why we chose to do that and then if i thought that what i was hearing was like the connection had to do something with because we were quoting and in trump slash g trump but but i couldn't figure out how they were related yeah no so if i'm if they're not related and we just did it because we felt like hey uh then then i'm on board i just want to make sure I'm not missing something important here. So, like, I actually have an understanding of the system before I just say, like, let's do that or let's not do that. And then it makes me question the reason we did it in the first place, because now I can't figure out how they would be related anyway. It was all really just a contrivance to be able to justify having OG in the system while also letting people buy Trump with G-Trump. Thank you. It was all really just a contrivance to be able to justify having OG in the system while also letting people buy Trump with G-Trump. I mean, G-Trump with Trump. That said, we will be driving volume from the G-Trump token to Trump token. So we're either hopping through other people's liquidity pools or our own but it's really hard for me to understand the math on how to think about that because i'll never have as much depth in our liquidity pool as the liquidity pools that will be available for like soul to trump for example and og to soul og to soul will be a very deep liquidity pool um trump the og should also be a pretty deep liquidity pool I'll see you next time. And OG to Seoul. OG to Seoul will be a very deep liquidity pool. Trump to OG should also be a pretty deep liquidity pool. But, or sorry, OG Trump. Sorry, OG to G Trump. This is also complicated to talk about verbally. OG to G Trump should be pretty deep. And then OG to Seoul should be pretty pretty deep but then you have to go back from soul to to trump so there's like it's just you're going from one swap to multiple swaps which i guess we'd have to do any well if we have a if we have an og to trump pool then there's not multiple swaps right there's just one correct yeah and if there's one swap and it's our pool then we're taking the fees or as long as we have like the best which we we have to maintain these liquidity pools so we maintain the the best volume and everything by having the best pricing yep um we'll be taking the fees, so we won't be making money on all these swaps instead of only losing money, which is the position we'll be in if we don't do it. So I guess that would be the argument is if you're creating all this volume, why not make money on it? But maybe we can just do it selectively based on the because we can just spin up liquidity tools based on like if we get to the point where top tokens are doing a lot of volume and we're like hey this trump like like we don't need to make it part of the graduation process yeah we can do it uh yeah on a case-by-case basis determined on what we think is best for the protocol right because we will have collected a lot of fees through the other liquidity pool yeah and we'll be able to take those fees and then just create a liquidity pool to do a more direct swap where we can take fees and then have like a mode where we switch to where we're being more efficient so that seems like that's the best way to resolve it is like there's one liquidity pool but we we spin up the second if if there's a lot of volume moving through and we're just Thank you. so that seems like that's the best way to resolve it is like there's one liquidity pool but we we spin up the second if if there's a lot of volume moving through and we're just burning money giving it to someone else when we could be doing it directly through our own then we just spin it up using all the fees that we've collected yeah it'll be seen as an investment so then we can actually just look at it and say how much liquidity we need to put in here? What will the return be? Is this thing going to net us money or not? Okay, then let's move forward like that. And then we can lower the graduation price, which is really interesting. Good. That is also another good thing. Yeah, can you follow up with Brees on that? Because I know he was worried about it. And I think that that contributes to another variable that we had that none of the other launchpads had, which is we were creating two liquidity pools with a higher bonding curve price. But now we're quoted in the same token, and we're graduating with the same amount of liquidity pools, and we're graduating at the same price. So now I don't really see any difference between our dynamic bonding for to graduation implementation for many other launch pads i agree so i guess that would mean that that brief should be unblocked on the the um the piece about the the number of decimal points or whatever he was talking about right? I'll double check with him uh he's been like he's been ramping up on getting uh into voting um because we figured let's give Meteora the the chance to to finally give them the solution that they keep saying they're going gonna deliver and but yeah but i'll bring him back to this okay um another thing i wanted to to flag for you is we kicked off the renegotiations with amplitude and um yeah we're paying them way too much money because we top ticked it back in the telegram days, thinking we were locking in a bunch of savings. But we spent a lot of money with them. And basically what we told them was, hey, we don't really want to pay for this at all, to be honest. Because right now we have, like, no traffic or no traffic that we're monitoring. So we essentially want to keep our data. So we're going to terminate this or you need to come back with, like plan that's you know like a thousand dollars a month max um and then the guy came back to us with like a went from like a 500k a year plan to like a 350 000 a year plan so he just thinks he's in like a regular negotiation so it didn't land so so we're serious we're like no no no really like I really am going to shut it off if we it there's literally no reason for us to be locking in 350k a year on for what we're using it for right now so um and we just don't have we don't even have the catch right now to be doing that like it's not we're not in the position we were in before so so my take is like it could be painful but we're in this weird they're always happy to take your money once you start growing and you call them and ask to work out a plan and they'll always give us the same sort of bulk discounting stuff that they're not going to penalize us for having terminated previously yeah but they're because they're a public company they're like really averse to losing um customers because shows up in their numbers. So the salespeople push really hard to just keep the contract because I guess like their job is judged partially based on churn, which creates a really weird set of incentives. And so like my plan is to really hold them to that, which is like they get us a us a contract that's, like, $1,000 a month or we just terminate. And just so you know. So that would mean if we terminate, obviously, we're just not using Apple II. Yes, maybe. I mean, I also feel that, like, a lot of the stuff we're doing is not – I mean, we've had this discussion before. But, like, there's enough – the leverage is not so much in the UI. Yes, it's not available. All the leverage the leverage in the ui and telegram yeah and almost none of the leverage is in the ui on what we're doing now it's like the ui has to be sufficiently good but but if we're spending a bunch of time running a b tests on ui we're probably not making any progress we probably have to be innovating on the incentives like like virtuals right this is true launching data is going to be far more valuable valuable to us Right, so I'm kind of wondering how valuable it's going to be in general It's not that it doesn't have any value. It's just like it's in web 2 It's it's like 98% of your analytics value and it feels like it might end up being like 5% With where we're headed. I think it is important for us to know how many people are coming I don't know how important it is anymore to know with exhaustive detail what they are doing. Because their activity will show on the blockchain. That's right. The ultimate conversion shows on the blockchain. And it's kind of useful to know where somebody falls off in a flow. But in many cases, it less about the quality of the ui and more about just like was it compelling enough on the incentive side yeah to get them to go through the things and so yeah so that's what i just want to give you a heads up so that's if i'm comfortable going out without i mean i'm not saying we have to be naked in terms of analytics but like i'm comfortable going out going out without Amplitude and just having some like very basic tracking with Google Analytics or something like and scrapping a lot of the taxonomy and then leaning in very obviously on the blockchain side, I don't want to sacrifice anything. We need to know all the stuff around how the tokens are trading. So, but just so you know where things are sitting with them. And then if we determine we want to use it later there's nothing stopping us from just like setting up a contract and sorting it out so yeah exactly we could always add on telemetry if we see that there's an area where more curious. Cool, okay. Alright, those are the two things I wanted to kick off with, but you can just go ahead now. Cool. Well, Kai is finally out. It's frustrating because when I met with him in the morning, he showed me a staking transaction that he had done to show that, okay, we already had that part on the front end working. He explained that there was, like it's showing in the, like the staking widget shows up in the top coins, not in the new coins. It doesn't show in the new and upcoming coins, basically because the upcoming coins, it was originally not part of that design. We were not gonna allow staking. So it just hasn't been implemented. And Kai was like, yeah, Carl's can do that in a few minutes. So I'm in that state of, well, yeah, in theory it works, but I needed to see it work and Kai's not here anymore. And it was a similar situation with when I tried to do the staking. And part of it was simply like, we're meeting and he's like, well, you know, I'm on the bus, I'm going to run. So I'm like, well, but can I do the staking? and he's like well you know i'm on the i'm on the bus i'm gonna run so i'm like well but can i do the staking and he's like yes you just have to send yourself tokens to your profile to your wallet profile which which makes sense however the the wallet the dev wallet has dozens of tokens with repeated names so it took me quite a few minutes to find a token that would be recognized and by that time Kyve had disappeared so it was like well for for all I so it was very like convenient for him to all of a sudden disappear um so Breeze has just come in and he's noticing the same things that I'm noticing and we've just been knocking him out. He's also now just been able to to finish the staking and he's starting in to vote but I'm hoping that when Carls comes in he really can fix the both the staking and finalize the the swapping on all three types of tokens. Oh, that's, yeah, sorry to hear that. That's like a, that's definitely a pattern. Yeah. Swooping in and like doing a lot and then swooping out with like really, a really extremely inconvenient timing and then making the bus or the train or the plane seem like something that's supposed to take priority We'll be right back. really um really extremely inconvenient timing and then making the bus or the train or the plane seem like like something that's supposed to take priority over whatever whatever he's supposed to be getting done um yeah i don't i don't know can't expect anything different at this point but i okay so it sounds like but a handoff in like farless and in breeze being somewhat in the back end and somewhat on the path is now underway. So we're not, like, we're not in this, at least if nothing else, like, next week and even for the rest of this week, we're not in the situation where we would have been if they didn't get up to speed, where it's just, like, we're just doing a bunch of smart contractor client stuff with no ability to touch the back end. Like, they're in there now now which is the first steps for us to be able to make any decisions about like the broader structure of the team is to have like some more redundancy on what people are able to to do and be comfortable and you know so anyway it's all it's all interrelated um That's good. Okay. All right. What's your take on the timing of this vertical slice then based on the latest? I think that it is still within the realm of possibility that it will, that Carlson and Brees can finish their bits in the next 48 hours. I'm not sure at all like it's it's a slam dunk but it is it is possible and if it doesn't get done in on friday like it can't be i mean i'll probably be better informed to make the claim that i'm about to make in four hours or five hours whatever but um but i still think it's it's i think it's way possible and that if it doesn't happen on friday it should happen monday or tuesday it seems like you've really been able to um get back into to working closely and managing engineers yeah i mean it it was it was a little bit of a ramp up because i had been so separated while all this thing was being built but over the last couple of days like yeah i feel i feel like i'm more you know at the very least aware of what the pieces are and what what the problem is with them it is you know it is just like when when we were launching gems which is very, very, you know, hands-on, monitoring all the time, following up, so it requires burning the candle at both ends, so it's not infinitely sustainable, but I'm fine for now, and Damon comes next week. What we were talking about with Mark and with Carlos is maybe it behooves us to have me share some of the managing stuff that Damon is doing, because we need him coding. That's what I was thinking too, because I think when we were running the Titus Engineering was actually when you were the most involved, when I reflect on the last year and a half. I think that there's less telephone involved because you're not managing specs through another layer. Damon just has a lot, and it creates even more confusion and missed dropped balls and stuff stuff so it gets things done faster because you're in a loop and then i think like you said damon has been a bottleneck for sure um the other with the other bottleneck being kai because he's just been we keep putting everything important sequentially on his plate and that's what this week has been about is like starting to make sure that barice and car and then hopefully Santosh, everyone can touch everything so he's no longer a bottleneck. Kai can't be a bottleneck. If we solve those two problems, we solve probably like half the speed issues of the execution of the team. I think so. So yeah, so like once I have Damon here that is in my time zone and I can just really go in there and ask really like like give me 15 minutes of your time and walk me from A to C on this thing so that I can explain it that's like gonna be probably the biggest missing piece for me to be able to have more of a grip yeah and we're gonna have to see like what when Damonon coming back like what everything is is like in his world um yeah i can't yeah his his schedule is certainly gonna be different his availability will reduce so we'll have to be really smart about how we use his time yeah hopefully hopefully he's in a position where he can like get normal sleep because i feel like that was already an occasional challenge for him and then sometimes with kids it can be really rough some people get lucky and like babies sleep really well and then other people have you know just really really tough times so it's just it's kind of random depending on the kids so we'll see we'll find out but um okay so look that's yeah because i've been really happy with like Thank you. It's kind of random depending on the kids, so we'll see. We'll find out. But, okay, so, look, that's, yeah, because I've been really happy with, like, all things considered, how things are going, and I feel like you have a skill set that, like, you know, that is unique on the team to actually do a good job of getting everybody organized. You know, even Damon, with his ability to understand and grasp so many things i think sometimes glosses over some of the details because if he were to do it himself he'd be able to fill them in but but we have a team that really requires like every single thing to be spelled out at the moment so um yeah i think i think it's been i've been happy with like the last few days and how that's going so i think you're right i think we should and it's it's it shouldn't be surprising because it's like how how gems went like i think you um you did a good job of getting everybody aligned and and working on shipping the thing and so that's that's where i think it makes sense for you to be spending a of your time and um yeah i am i mean more broadly like we i've uh you know like last few weeks i guess i've i've kind of internalized these the the opportunity costs of having not been out and um like i mentioned the other day you know having looked at like the numbers and then just saying like wow okay if we're out we're like probably top four or five we're we're talking about a hundred to five hundred thousand dollars a day in revenue depending on the day and whatever and just realizing the weight of that has has like amped up the the stress on my end about like feeling like we're just not making fast enough progress because once the once the um cost of not being out get that high it's like it really makes you and i don't think it's delusion i think it's it's just a the truth and in a weird way um you know we kick this thing off in febru the meme market, meme coin market, which is kind of like beginning to deflate rapidly. But I don't think it's it's necessarily that since since then, over the last four months, that like the outlook for for meme coins has changed a whole lot. I think it's changed a little bit, but not any more than we really expected. In in fact some of these big ones like trump are still they're still doing probably better than most people would have expected four months ago when things started deflating so i think that the um the thing that i've realized is that like every time some new solana launch pad or product launches they just keep kind of taking liquidity and then pumped up fun all the revenue they make and they keep in their cruiseries is um sucking liquidity out from all the solana creators and so like the longer this stuff goes on and you're not out also like the more the more liquidity begins to deflate from a particular chain chain like you get these wealth wealth creation moments like solana went up in price then people said wow okay i don't have that many games left on solana so they start gambling in the pump fun casino and then solana takes a billion dollars of liquidity out of the ecosystem which doesn't seem like that much but i think it's more than people think because so much of the trades are back and forth with low fees that a lot of it is just money shuffling around right so sometimes it seems like oh there's trillions of dollars going on in blockchain but the reality is like you can't sell all trillion dollars and get it out that's that's the market cap based on the price if everyone were able to sell at the the current prices for all the assets which is just not the case so um it's it's really hard to gauge like how much how much actual money is in is in the solana ecosystem these other ecosystems because we we look at trading volumes and it's always so impressive but like the cost to move these these this money around now is so low that you can be moving hundreds of millions of dollars like believe can do a hundred million dollars in volume in a day and it's like how does that even possible well because they're only taking you know two percent out so um it's it's like these people are you know the fees are low it's not revenue it's trading volume so um i i guess i guess what i'm what i'm getting at is like i don't know the point where there's the liquidity in solana is just like exhausted but it does feel like it's going to come um to me just as a cycle type of thing and and it probably is in the summer that's kind of my take like just reading the vibes in the room um and so like i just feel like we and and i think we can weather through that and deal with it or whatever know, virtuals and other projects have proven if you do something interesting that adds value in some other way, then, like, people will just keep coming and you get more shots at it. So, I don't feel the need to time the market with what we're doing, but we definitely don't want to go out in the trough of that. So, yeah, that's, I really feel like we need to get out the first version of this in June and I don't know I feel like at this point it's hard for me to it's becoming increasingly difficult for me to go and just give any deadline with with any real sort of credibility and like i but in some weird way i feel like i've always been trying to put a deadline based on this vertical slice which always has been two weeks away but then the list of things that comes before these things has always grown these things have always never happened so what i really meant was like get the playable slice which was a two-week goal that could have happened if we did not do any of the other things yeah um but which in a weird way it's like it's always been true that we've been two weeks away from from this vertical slice but instead we we did all these other things that maybe or maybe we shouldn't have done that led us to take so long to get to this thing and now i'm glad because like there's a lot of naive things we did in the original design that i think the more talks token communities and others would have caused problems and we could have learned those things in public or we could have learned them in private um and some set of them we learned in private and and some of them you know the good chunk of them that are better that we learned in private we're not getting sued by the trumps um you know we are like like and we're getting close to being able to do a deal with them like i'm meeting with eric soon um and we're we're not um and i think we figured out much better mechanics on like the like we weren't even planning to do community distribution we were planning on letting anyone launch these tokens a couple months ago a lot of these things would have been huge mistakes and some of them would have been one-way doors um where like if we let anybody launch the tokens i think that would have went very poorly and it would have been very hard to walk back so i you know i'm glad i'm glad i feel like now we're at this place where like the design is in a really interesting place and the biggest risk with it would be that it would be too conservative not too aggressive and where there's a previous one was like too too aggressive Let's do it. like the design is in a really interesting place and the biggest risk with it would be that it would be too conservative not too aggressive and where there's a previous one was like too too aggressive in a sense like anyone can launch any token and it's wide open or whatever right so um i guess like i'm anxious to get it out so that we put our flag in the ground because i really do think this is like a shelling point where as long as we have the coins out and the narrative out first, then all the capital flows to us and then no one else will really be able to do it. And we'll have time to sort out a lot of the details just because we won't have time. I mean, the markets move fast. And if you fuck up and you're dead to people, well, then they move on really quick within a week. But as long as we get them to believe and stay believing in the narrative and and fix the things that we need to fix then i think we have we have weeks and months to get like all the game content in and a lot of the other things that we're worried about that are big and hard a lot of those things could take time to happen and like people would be okay with it as long as price is okay so yeah that's the big if yeah and and i've started to realize that price is more dependent on the other things than even more dependent on on um some of the things that we like we're probably ahead in our thinking on a lot of the things that that um make this these real ecosystems than any of these other launchers i mean believe coin and just said, hey, there's a founder and they launch a coin and that's it. Kind of attached to their company, but there's no mechanisms. We're coming up with all these mechanisms and all this other stuff. And they had none of that. They're just like, hey, there's a thing and you launch a coin and it's attached to somebody's company and we'll figure out the rest later and um so that but i i think that that's okay like i think that that's a a good a good thing to some extent because we'll have a very credible like virtuals that'll make people look at this thing as like very credible like when people look at virtuals and all the design they've done around the thinking around the agents and the agent treasury and all this stuff they're like well there's something you know this is a real experiment with real iteration happening frequently that's driving towards some sort of outcome and i don't know if it's going to work but there's some like 10% chance or something that it does and therefore i'll price it like this because there's no one else in the world who's figuring out how like self-sovereign agents have their own wallets and is iterating every week and has all the capital flowing into them to figure it out so it's just like this probabilistic bet that some smart people are willing to make yeah and i feel like that's the position we could be in is like the best outcome is like a or not the best outcome the best outcome is it all just works very quickly and it proof is in the pudding. The second best outcome is, oh, wow, this is a really interesting concept. They're sort of halfway there on having figured out every piece, but they keep iterating and they have all the capital, like virtuals. And because every week things keep getting better, the probability on this thing working over the next year is pretty high so i'm going to park my money here that's those are the two um good outcomes so i had a i had a call with uh caps from jupiter he's kind of meows number two and um his name is real he's indian so it's k-a-s-h not cash c-a-s-h um and uh and anyway he i wanted to talk to him about doing a jupiter game coin and he's actually on board which is a big deal because i think jupiter is a top four token in solana so you know we have we have all these meme coins on board but now we have the number one coin you can get in solana that isn't solana itself is is jupiter um and they said they he's 100 they're gonna do it with us nice so so we really do we have such a such a setup here it's just kind of crazy he did have good feedback like one of the interesting things about talking to him is all these meme coins have had different sort of distribution stories um whereas like jupiter every every coin has their own story for how they did their airdrops and how it came to be and how their community was formed or whatever he had really interesting feedback on like how we should handle the claim mechanism and he's like you gotta be really careful not to call it airdrop we keep calling it airdrop but it's not an airdrop right people have to come and claim it it's true um so so he was saying like this idea of getting to a five percent threshold to be a launcher is a really good idea he thought this was very smart um but he thought that giving a broad distribution to the rest of the token holders might be a mistake to the base holders yeah so say we launch juke game coin and and then we have five points goes to the launchers and then 15 points goes to all the other juke holders there are a couple things he pointed out he said one um for the five percent of token of of the the launchers that vote he's like you got to think if it's circulating supply or total supply um and i hadn't thought a lot about that because you know for the meme coins in many cases it's the same right um but for people like them they have a ton of of lost token because when we start doing protocols there's a huge difference between between circulating supply and and total supply and he's like so i think you should make it five percent of circulating supply because in some cases five percent of total supply might be like 15 or 20 percent of all the token which is probably going to get really hard to do um so that was the first really useful point of feedback that would be like a dumb mistake to have made but just talking to somebody who had a token distribution like it's obvious once he said it but something that we didn't think about so i don't know does that make sense to you i think so yeah i mean the other thing that i think about is both many of those base coins probably have terrible guinea coefficients so like giving 15 to base coin holders how much of that is going to jump into like the top five coin holders already right like if we get 15 to trump to trump holders how much is the trump group itself getting and does it benefit us or not i don't know yeah so he said um he's not opposed to paying whales his bigger concern around the claim first of all he's like yeah airdrops are terrible because you know there's so many spam airdrops that everyone just sells everything they get in their wallet and they don't know what it is so claims are better which we're already doing but he said you should never give anyone money if you don't give them enough he said there's a very weird psychological thing that they've they've just seen with all the token launches they've done where like if you give someone money but you give them like less than ten dollars they just they they feel entitled to what you've given them because you told them they deserved it but they feel like you didn't give them enough and if you give them nothing then no one complains um so so he was saying like you need to make sure he's like you got to model out how many people can i give like at least a hundred dollars and and if i can't give them a hundred dollars and like i probably shouldn't even put them in the airdrop because what you really want to do is build an actual complaints yeah you're yeah you're creating complaints and you're not creating fans in a real community to create fans in a real community you need to make some people rich or make them a good chunk of money if you don't make them rich um and and like then they they they become very grateful and they stay as holders so he was just saying like look you might want to consider just giving even more to the people who launch the token but then the more you get to the launch of the token then the less there there is left over to give it to the rest of the token holders and it kind of begs the question like do you just give the whole thing to like launchers or something right so that was also something i i hadn't thought about that i think he's he's right about which is like say say you did do five percent threshold but then 20 of the game coin just went to those launchers like you have way fewer people that from those those token communities that got it but they'd be self-selected to be the people who took the initiative that care about the game coin are way less likely to sell and you'd make them a lot more money so they'd be much more loyal than giving them a small amount um and and then having all these other people random people who get some that don't care then they just instant but so so yeah it's like how do you he's like look people have to think about their token just like nfts you kind of have to think about it like as an art collector or an art salesperson or gallery it's like you won't just sell it to anybody you have to like you're qualifying the customer because if you you sell the the art to someone who's just going to dump it then the value of the art goes down and if you want the value of the art to go up you need to make sure just like the watch salesman people and everything else like you're only selling it to people you know won't sell so the whole token distribution thing of to your point it's unfortunate but like the whole guinea coefficient thing of like how it actually works is like a lot of times you want to give it to whales because they're just way less likely to dump and um you're giving it to people who just like famous artists want to have um billionaires hold their part because they're not going to sell it yeah and so the value can continue to go up so i don't in our case like i guess the decision point on this like i thought that was really good feedback and makes sense based on what i've heard but i don't think that we thought this part through enough and it's i guess the the point is like we should we should make a call like are we you know what price would would a token have to get to in many of the different market cap situations for these other people to get this 15% claim and be happy with it versus just like annoyed or it doesn't even make sense or they're fighting it because they're like hey this is dumb look this thing has you can go claim your $1 of this game coin, who cares why they've been doing this, right? Yeah, so that's, or do you like, what would the distribution be? Is it launchers and some other group of people that you can reward much more heavily? That's what I thought was useful from this conversation to figure out because he's much more thoughtful about this than like the other token teams we've talked to who don't even really think about this stuff. Yeah, that's actually really, really, really good points that he's making. I need to digest that. because then yeah we have to re like like it makes sense in some ways to maybe like definitely in like maybe even increase the chunk for the launchers um but yeah it's like do we do anything for for base coin holders at all like any small percentage or just zero because based on what i'm hearing it's just zero well yeah because if you increase the launchers pool like say hey look instead of five percent ten percent now you have ten percent left over for everybody else in which case the rewards become even less significant so it begs the question of like why are you giving them anything at all yeah right that's but there may be another way of qualifying holders within the the token pool that we think are high quality i just i i haven't thought of one yet so like launchers is a nice self-selecting mechanism and the bigger bag you give to the launchers the more they're on the hook to go promote it anyway and so the insight here is like hopefully five percent of the tokens or five percent of the circulating supply of tokens is pretty pretty hard threshold to get to. So you're getting enough for the community where, like, these are people who can go and move the needle. It's not easy to just get to 5%. Like, one of these large market cap tokens, like, for Jupiter to get to 5%, he thought we could do it. They get 13% average participation on their governance stuff. So he thought 5% is doable um it's going to take a lot of people coming and showing up but he's going to give us access to all the channels he's going to promote it and meow's account and jupiter's account and everything else that he thinks is just going to happen um but the point is like if if you get those people signed up and vote and voting to launch then you probably end up in a situation where if you give them a really big bag and then you put the lockup. He said the lockup idea is a very good idea that we should 100% do that, which is you get milestones based on market cap for the lockup for these people. And the bigger bag they have, the more they care about the lockup. yeah so that's the other thing is like if we just do the claim and everyone's getting like a dollar worth of stuff then no one cares about when the lock up ends right um but if we just make it all launcher pool and these guys actually have a lot of money that they can get then then they're going to have a lot of pressure to go and and promote it to everyone in their community who didn't get a free a free claim and then if maybe the optics are better if if the launchers launched it and it's enough people from the community that everybody had their fair chance to be the people who launched the game point and it's a good chunk of them because it's five percent then all the people who didn't weren't involved with it can't really complain they didn't get anything and maybe they're less likely to complain if they'd get nothing versus if they got 50 cents is an interesting insight right like if some guy makes like ten thousand dollars on launching this thing and then a bunch of other people make 50 cents they're probably like what the hell happened here but if it's just the people who took the initiative to launch the game coin make good money and then everybody else didn't get anything because they didn't help you might actually be in a much better situation psychologically so why not then give launchers a cool 10 like a full flat 10 instead of five and room and return the rest to the bonding curve we could return to the bonding curve it just or do we it's hard for me to i don't understand the trade-off of or it could go to the rewards right yeah um or it could be give the launchers even more give them 20 because at the end of the day it's like if we the bonding curve people are kind of shitheads that's kind of what we're learning right you look at all these other i mean if if you go and look at all these other protocols that are just launch pads that have launched recently what you see time and time again is you're gambling on who buys the supply first and it's often these snipers increasingly though and and they they don't add a lot of value they're just extracting and you're helping to do price discovery but if you think about like the people who are actually in a position to add value it's the people from the original community so if you if you can i don't know that's the case for just giving them 20 because basically like if you enrich a bunch of people from the juke game coin or the trump that that took the initiative to go invoke to get the thing launched then they're going to be grateful that you made them a lot of money and they're going to make sure that this is a thing that everybody in that community knows about and if you put it on an unlocked schedule where they're they're forced to pump the price because they have bigger and bigger bags um yeah i mean you you have the exact people who are in the position to promote the thing with the biggest bags whereas anyone who buys in the bonding curve is just some rando who's either got a sniper set up or whatever and then you solve the governance part too ian which is pretty interesting right like if 20 of the supply is held by by people who actually hold the the original coin and have opted in to thinking that the game coin is a good idea yeah they have a very strong interest in governing the thing properly yeah and the thing is just more legit so so yeah the more i thought about this i was like maybe the whole he's just like you always got to do smaller smaller claims and more directed um claims and so you know the drawback of this is you're going to miss a bunch of people but you're self-selecting for people who actually think this is a good idea um now there's gonna be mercenaries in there too because like once people learn how this works there's gonna be some people are just like this is a way to get a bunch of supply of a thing very easily and so you'll get people who are farming these other tokens for sure and I don't think there's really anything we can do about that like that's that's just the way the world works every system eventually gets has people that will try to exploit it yeah yeah but we're trying the point he made to me that i thought was really interesting is he's like you actually want every community should be like a little bit like different like you don't want the community for the game coin to be the same community as the base coin because most people that have the base coin don't care about the game coin but you need to figure out who the people are that care about the game coin and make sure that they're very richly rewarded so that they go do all the work or that some of them go do the work he's like it's you know it's one percent that go do the work but you make money for a hundred people and one or two of them are actually going to go out of their way to really promote the thing yeah that's and yeah so look i mean i don't know that we give it back to the bonding curve no in fact now now the argument is should we make the nest egg of like that like that um you know that little piggy bank that people are looking for would be so big like what's the number that is the optimal size of reward that gets people optimally invested it's a 10 it's a 20 it's all like am i making sense yeah it makes sense so like ego did the launch pad a few weeks ago where you can launch anybody's social profile and 50% goes to the person who owns a social profile when they claim. I don't know that we're in a situation where we want to give that much because these could end up being much bigger, I think, than any individual random social profile. So it's more about dollar value than percentage um and then i think about these market cap gates that you've been thinking about on the lockup timing and i think that's where the the rubber meets the road on this stuff which is like if it gets to a million dollar market cap this is 20 percent um say we give only launchers is 20 that's 200 000 that's a value that's um held by those people but like that's not the final gate i don't know what the were you thinking the final gate is 10 million market cap or what where do we what were you thinking we didn't i was i was going to ask if if we should go as high as 500 uh 500 million actually oh wow that's really high yeah um because i yeah i mean it's hard to say right like the market's wildly fluctuating for meme coin launch pads it seems like things keep getting smaller and smaller um but then you have the belief stuff where many things hit like 10 million yeah yeah and then their main coin hit like over 100 million or something or 200 million at one point so like i don't know it's hard it's hard to say i just want nothing could be too like for me i think of it as a like a very exponential curve in the sense that you know you know it's just like balancing balancing game difficulty you you make it you know more attractive at first and then that difficulty starts to ramp up but the reward also gets you know proportionally bigger so 500 million would just be like instant unlock obviously yeah it's a terminal one exactly but and it's happens below that or something it's what so So yeah it's like you started so you start at 120 um and you know you have there's the five drops you know the um graduation month one month two month three and month four um so each each one of those goes from 120 at the start to 250 to 1 million to 10 million to 100 million or something like that So that you either wait the entire five months and get the entire supply or you Like hit it out of the park and get to 500 million but 500 million might be too ambitious at the end of the day like i mean it's mean i i know we should like i don't know whether to think of them as meme coins in this perspective or not but five months is a long time for the lockup right yeah for a meme coin i think it's reasonable though especially if we're giving especially if we're giving more of the supply to these people this is another reason that i think that's just right which is like if we if we give it to everybody then five months is like dude it's it's a dollar like who cares and even if it goes to 100 million it might not be enough money for most of these people to care so they're not going to do anything to move the lockup yeah but if you get like 100 people I don't know. like who cares and even if it goes to Hundred million it might not be enough money for most these people to care. So they're not going to do anything to move the lockup Yeah But if you get like a hundred people who are all had hundreds of thousands of dollars on the line If they hit the biggest numbers then everyone starts to really move. Yeah Yeah, and they have the ability to move to Yeah, so look I I like this yeah i like this approach um i think 500 seems really steep just based on where things are at right now but we can always adjust i feel like 100 is like ambitious and and won't be seen as crazy yeah that's kind of where my head is at like 100 is like damn that's a runner that's huge nowadays you know nothing goes to 100 anymore these things like hit 10 and that's kind of the permanence for all these meme coins but but then yeah things get to 100 that are really good like believes launch coin yeah that's 100 so 100 seems like very very ambitious um and people won't just scoff at it so they're like okay that's possible but so but 500 seems like we're gonna get a lot of like just bud people was just like no lol like that's impossible I think you're right that would be exaggeration but yeah if I mean the good thing about a hundred is that it's easy to grok it's 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 so yeah and then if you make if you get to a hundred the the launchers made 20 million if they held Which is a shit ton of money. I mean depending on how they Divided it up for someone like Jupiter or 5% means maybe getting hundreds of people involved We don't know but like this could be whales that make a lot of money on that yeah okay yeah i think this is interesting because it creates a real it's much more likely to create a real community instead of just trying to like yeah whenever you give these airdrop rewards that are to too many people he's right if you just look back at like the last couple years when no one thanks you when you just give everybody in a community a little bit of money yes they don't they don't care the only things that get published to the timeline are when you make when you make um some people a very real amount of money and then some people will complain that they shouldn't have they should have been included like oh i should have been included in that or whatever but like that's better than the fud when when you just don't pay people enough for anyone to care. Yeah it's much better to to having missed out than to having gotten a crappy and crappy number. The weird part about this thing is just how different the different market caps and the different base tokens are so. It's really crazy I've been trying to get like a distribution chart of market caps but I got sidetracked but I've got like half of the query written in doing because I figure if I can see all the meme coin market caps in one single curve we can make a like okay this this these numbers makes sense this week this week yes um yeah yeah it's i think it's it's fine to just do the the hundred million sort of terminus to lock up for everything and then just go out with it and just see we can't let perfect be the enemy of good here and then we just got to get out with a simple system that seems reasonable and then creates incentives we like and then when people are like hey man i just launched troll coin it's a five million dollar market cap coin and you're telling me i have to get to 100 million for the games it's like well i don't know try harder you know it's just funny it's like whatever you gotta go make a lot of games go figure it out and then troll coin will grow too and it might even be possible to to multiply you know the value of some of these base coins by by many multiples if you create a lot of really interesting games and you get a lot of heat around a game ecosystem maybe that does make one of these other meme coins run i mean it wouldn't be surprising if this really works that shouldn't be the case where someone revives a uh kind of like half dead meme coin and they grow at many multiples because a new narrative formed around the games should be possible so okay those are the major those are the major things so just steering toward this um i guess we have on the fee side um i think you and i talked about doing two percent i don't know if you like relayed all this stuff to to breeze i think we can get away with it i think once we get big basically the game we have to play is you have to keep adjusting the liquidity pool to be competitive before um someone just goes and lowers the fees more um but that's okay because the bigger you get the more volume you're doing the more the absolute dollars are coming in anyway so as you're adjusting the fees lower like it's more like you're you're asymptoting on the amount of revenue you're capturing not like you're losing revenue if you're doing it right yeah so but I think everything adds up to the two percent fees and how it's split up between all the pools and belief changed their fee structure so that 70 goes to craters now i don't i don't think we need to do that and i'm not sure i think part of the reason they did that is because a lot of people were complaining that originally um the fees weren't like being rewarded properly to to the creator so a lot of creators are complaining that they weren't getting what they expected so I don't think we need to make I feel like the reason they made that change is unrelated to us and in part because they were using damn dmv1 and when they switch to dmv2 the these should be consistent and they won't have that issue, so. I agree. I think that's the way to go. Okay. Alright, Justin, I actually really want to get back to Breeze. He's been waiting for a while for an answer. Yeah, yeah, makes sense. Yeah, just please get him updated on the latest tokenomics stuff we talked to here so he's prepared for it. And I guess the cool thing about doing launchers only I'll see you next time. waiting for a while. All right. Yeah, yeah. Makes sense. Yeah, just please get him updated on the latest tokenomics stuff we talked to here so he's prepared. Yeah. Or and I guess the cool thing about doing the launchers only getting this stuff is it's like a somewhat of a reduction in scope if we don't have two pools and simpler UI. And yeah, we're removing a whole set of claims. Yeah. Okay, so we'll change the modal and the banner to be now about launchers get 10 20 percent do we fail fall 20 yeah just giving i think 20 is actually good like it's a real weighty amount of it's a legit like they really own this thing yeah okay i'll run with that cool all right ian all right sir good talking to you bye thank you bye",
