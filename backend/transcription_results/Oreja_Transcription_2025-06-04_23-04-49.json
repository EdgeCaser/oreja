I think maybe best would Ian: if you could merge your work or something. Ian: I'm going to be out so you can have a look. Ian: Okay. Ian: I did you as a reviewer, just have a look, it's not that big. Ian: retrieving token amounts in proper format, Ian: explaining token amounts properly, Ian: accounting from decimals? Ian: Yes. Ian: . Ian: amounts and retrieving staking quantities for display onboard content. Ian: So this basically fixes front-end, but it doesn't fix Ian: the action of staking? Ian: The action of staking actually works. Ian: it doesn't Ian: work for me Ian: I haven't Ian: been able Ian: to get it Ian: to work Ian: um Ian: I mean, I just illustrated now, right, in staging. Ian: Oh, okay. Yeah, I was not looking. So you had to talk Ian: So this amount that you see here is not correct. Ian: So I'm also fixing this. Ian: available you have 1.2 million this is yeah that amount is hard-coded let me show you Ian: and in case you were not paying attention, right? Ian: Like I enter a value Ian: here, right? This is a token that was created, right? Ian: I've actually shared wallet to send myself some tokens that I was able to stake. Ian: So basically, I created this Jitoken now, right? Ian: Yeah. Ian: Maurice, let's just send him some of the whatever token it is that he has. Ian: we're supposed to give him I just don't know which one we should send him if I Ian: apply with this, right? Brice Chevalier: Yeah, for me it was just not working, it's good stuff. Ian: This doesn't work, it doesn't do anything. Brice Chevalier: Yeah, me too. It was just non-responsive. So I was wondering if it was just me Ian: I mean, Breaking Kai was supposed to... I mean, has this... Ian: in his place for two months. Ian: I don't understand why it's not working, you know? Brice Chevalier: The swab just changed because of the material. Brice Chevalier: for refactoring. Brice Chevalier: made it work but maybe he forgot to plug something maybe it's almost working Ian: That's the end of Mayday, but they can have a look tomorrow morning. Ian: But for now, we can send you some tokens, guys. Carles Vallve: Yeah, I think that's the easiest thing to do. Ian: Okay, so can you send me some tokens? Ian: Yeah, can you copy past the address? Brice Chevalier: So I'm gonna, I'm going to send you some Ian: Doug. Ian: I'll send you some 2 million. Ian: Cat dog. Oh, no way. Speaker SPEAKER_01: Ah, no. Ian: I'm going to mistake. Ian: I sent you a kid. Ian: instead of sending you GameCamp. Brice Chevalier: Right. Ian: Ja, maar dat is niet ook... Brice Chevalier: Send. Ian: I'm sending you 200,000 Brice Chevalier: Can you send me some other token too? Brice Chevalier: Yeah, maybe... Ian: So do we have some work? Ian: No, we don't have any... Unknown Speaker: No. Ian: Do we have any, what do you say? Ian: Aïe. Ian: Do we have any questions? Ian: that's the only token that can be Ian: steak Ian: that I Ian: have Ian: that's Ian: the only Ian: any token that can be staked? Ian: And that I have in the wallet. Ian: I see. Carles Vallve: Sí, tenemos que tener la capacidad de crear Ian: new tokens and swap them. We're gonna run out of CatDog. Unknown Speaker: Não. Ian: Não. Ian: Não. Unknown Speaker: Não. Ian: Não. Ian: The way I see it, if you guys really want to build a vertical slice, Ian: first thing we need to fix is buy-sell. Ian: So we can create a G-token, buy some of it, Ian: then own it and be able to stake. Yes? Yes. That's how everything should work. Brice Chevalier: So, yeah, I didn't touch it because I was not sure it was completely broken. Brice Chevalier: on what was going on. Ian: Okay. Ian: Yeah. Ian: I don't know if it was me. Ian: I can try to fix it tomorrow morning. Ian: Okay, let's do that. Brice Chevalier: So then breathe. Brice Chevalier: okay, we need to fix the buy and sell, right? Brice Chevalier: Then... Brice Chevalier: Once we can buy some of this g-token, Brice Chevalier: This should work, right? Brice Chevalier: Yes."
