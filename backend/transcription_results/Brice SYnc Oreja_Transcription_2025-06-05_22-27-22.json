Ian: None of them. Brice: Well, some are better than none. Ian: Yeah. Ian: Um. Ian: Yeah. Ian: Yeah. Ian: Yeah. Ian: So how's the how's the day looking up now towards the end? Ian: Yeah Ian: So I fixed a few issues, so first it was Ian: difficult to debug whatever problem was happening in the back end. So I added some logs, make Ian: It makes it easier now to see what's going on. Brice: some problems in the back end where some new SDK APIs Brice: were not implemented. Brice: So the backend was failing because of this. Brice: fixed it, deployed Brice: There was another problem. Ian: I forgot what I did was, you know, Ian: Sentry is not working. Brice: but still not working, not sure why. Ian: I didn't have too much time to look into it. Brice: So I figured that there's one problem now. Ian: didn't really fix, but I found the reason why it was not working. Brice: we couldn't Brice: another reason Brice: why we couldn't Brice: swap Brice: buy-in Brice: buy and sell Brice: G-tokens Brice: was because Brice: the Ian: the format of the old GDogons were not compatible with the new ones. Brice: It was a new EPA. Brice: I remember reading that, yeah. Brice: Yeah. Brice: So we need to create, we need to launch new Dtokens. Brice: if you want to test Brice: buy and sell Brice: then I figured Brice: again Brice: like the UI was wrong in pretty few places. Brice: So as I said, I'm Brice: So I'm working on it now. Ian: is almost ready then. Ian: Uh... Ian: I think so. Ian: I think that was a problem. Brice: What was it? Ian: I don't know. Ian: if I should show this Solana tokens or something else because right now is I'm not trading against Ian: So what should I show? Brice: You mean what quote token to use? Brice: Yeah, it's a good token, like just the icon. Brice: I mean, we're going to move. Brice: towards Solana so you might as well implement that okay okay so Brice: Just be aware that it's not actually Solana. Ian: Okay, and no word yet on... Brice: Staking? Brice: What do you mean? Brice: So staking is working, right? Brice: The bot, maybe. Brice: Let me double check. Brice: Oh, that's right, but you need to have the right tokens. Brice: and I don't, and that's why I can't. Brice: Okay. Brice: Um... Ian: Well, it's been said I still contested because Brice: because I need to get some of the original meme token to test. Brice: I don't think so. Brice: Yeah. Brice: I don't know, if you make a new one, it's just taking some time to figure out how to list it and everything. Brice: Well, it's Friday for you, and Santosh is back. Brice: Oh, wait. Brice: No, Santos is not back next week, no. Brice: Never mind. Brice: I got excited for a moment, but Damon's back next week, so hopefully he can help pick up Brice: Kaya is back on Thursday. Brice: When is Sintash Brice: coming? Brice: Thank you. Brice: I think he's back on... Brice: Yeah, he left for two weeks. Brice: At least that's my understanding, he didn't put it in the team calendar so I don't know Brice: of that. Brice: Okay, um, dude, I feel awful, so I'm... Brice: I'm going to let you go and I'm going to ask Brice: Carl if he can Brice: do it now or Brice: or he could leave async because I'm really not feeling well. Brice: Okay. Brice: Yeah. Brice: I mean. Brice: Okay. Brice: Yeah. Brice: all right sir well then I will let you go and I'll leave a note and Brice: thread in our channel. We're good. Okay. Tell Brice: Talk to you later. Brice: Have a great weekend. Brice: You too. Brice: Bye."
