[222.0s - 224.0s] Unknown Speaker: I'm going to put it in my bag.
[224.0s - 227.0s] Unknown Speaker: I'm going to put it in my bag.
[227.0s - 230.0s] Unknown Speaker: I'm going to put it in my bag.
[230.0s - 232.0s] Unknown Speaker: I'm going to put it in my bag.
[233.0s - 236.0s] Unknown Speaker: I'm going to put it in a little bit.
[236.0s - 239.0s] Unknown Speaker: I'm going to put it in a little bit.
[239.0s - 242.0s] Unknown Speaker: I'm going to put it in a little bit.
[242.0s - 245.0s] Unknown Speaker: I'm going to put it in a little bit.
[245.0s - 247.0s] Unknown Speaker: I'm going to put it in a little bit.
[247.0s - 249.0s] Unknown Speaker: I'm going to put it in a little bit.
[249.0s - 251.0s] Unknown Speaker: I'm going to put it in a little bit.
[251.0s - 253.0s] Unknown Speaker: I'm going to put it in a little bit.
[253.0s - 255.0s] Unknown Speaker: I'm going to put it in a little bit.
[253.0s - 278.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: IAN, I DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE NOAH SUGGESTION, I WASN'T CLEAR ON IT ABOUT INSTEAD OF STAKING BUT VOTING.
[276.0s - 286.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: it's it's instead of you connecting the wallet you somehow are able to prove
[286.1s - 292.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: that you have that money without ever showing me the wallet or at least ever
[292.2s - 301.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: showing me the address of the wallet oh so like yeah like we said
[299.0s - 303.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: approved type of deal yeah like we use a third party set as like somebody uses a third party
[303.8s - 311.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: service i assume that says okay yeah this person has the that that amount and that's
[311.1s - 316.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: and that's all they have they have to provide as opposed to having to provide the wallet
[316.1s - 324.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: but yeah it's uh i don't like the solution i think i think the
[322.0s - 330.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I think part of what we want is for there to be skin in the game
[330.8s - 334.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: and for the LTV to increase.
[334.5s - 337.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: So that is the thing that I don't like about that solution.
[340.2s - 340.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: All right.
[341.8s - 342.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Hey, guys.
[342.9s - 343.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Hey, Justin.
[343.5s - 343.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: How's it going?
[345.0s - 350.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Yeah, pretty good. Welcome back, Damon.
[350.0s - 352.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Thank you very much.
[352.0s - 355.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: How are things? Everything is going well?
[355.0s - 358.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Yeah, everybody's healthy, so what more can I ask for?
[358.0s - 363.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: I'm just still adjusting to sleep schedule.
[363.0s - 370.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: I mean, luckily I feel I've functioned on a whole bunch of sleep for a long time.
[368.0s - 373.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: Not a whole bunch of sleep for a long time, so just like planning around it, but it's
[373.6s - 378.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: getting a little more predictable, at least this phase.
[378.0s - 382.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Like baby needs diaper or baby needs food or diaper, one of those two.
[382.2s - 388.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Yeah, there's not much else for a bit, so it's pretty straightforward.
[388.7s - 389.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: That's good.
[389.7s - 393.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I'm glad everything's going well.
[391.0s - 405.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so I was just talking with Ian about the whole launcher term.
[405.0s - 416.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Well, I knew the term, but the staking aspect, we need to figure out a UX for that.
[419.0s - 424.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: And then I guess Mark had some comments as well on that.
[424.7s - 427.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Maybe we want to just go over real quick.
[427.9s - 431.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: OK, yeah, I picked off a little bit of the UI UX stuff
[431.3s - 433.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: with me last week, and then you said
[433.3s - 435.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: it was going to continue, Ian, but I'm not sure
[435.3s - 437.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: if they had a chance to meet on it.
[437.0s - 439.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: We are meeting tomorrow at 7 AM, my time.
[441.5s - 445.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: You're welcome to join, David.
[445.1s - 449.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Yeah, basically, Damon, what we're trying to do
[449.0s - 455.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: is we did a bunch of customer development on game creators
[455.6s - 456.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: and AI platforms.
[456.7s - 458.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Remember, I reached out to all these game developers
[458.5s - 462.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: and vibe coding platforms and everything.
[460.0s - 462.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: web coding platforms and everything months ago.
[462.7s - 466.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So we kind of learned a lot about what we would need to solve for them,
[466.4s - 472.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: like the publishing stuff and game registering APIs and all this parts.
[472.3s - 475.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And then we never really spent a lot of time with token communities.
[475.2s - 481.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Like what does the GigaChat community need to succeed?
[481.7s - 485.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: What does any of these random token communities need to succeed?
[483.0s - 487.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: any of these random token communities need to succeed. And then we recently, over the last
[487.0s - 492.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: month or so, started meeting a lot more with them. And then Scott started coming up with all these
[492.0s - 496.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: schemes of like, well, what do they want to launch, right? They want a bunch of the token,
[496.7s - 503.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: right? They need significant exposure, okay? Now, we need to work with people who have
[503.1s - 508.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: access to the Telegram or the X channels that run these accounts so that they can
[508.9s - 511.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Oh, and then there's this random guy who has an account
[511.0s - 514.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: that a lot of people follow, but it's not the official account.
[514.2s - 515.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So how does he get exposure?
[516.0s - 517.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Because he's really important and key,
[517.6s - 520.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: but he doesn't run the GigaChat account.
[520.6s - 523.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: There's like five or six accounts that would all be interesting
[523.7s - 525.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: to have promoting GigaChat, but none of them are official.
[526.1s - 531.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And so you run into this, it becomes apparent that...
[529.0s - 535.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: that um you you need to coordinate like a bigger group of people for one of these launches to be
[535.8s - 542.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: successful and so and then on the other hand we we realized that like this idea of just kind of
[542.1s - 548.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: approving these one by one and then working with these groups is way too slow um like finding these
[548.3s - 554.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: people and then talking with them even though we have for a lot of the top tokens now um
[557.6s - 561.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: gets what like oh this guy gets one percent and this guy gets point one percent and this guy gets
[561.6s - 567.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: this you don't even know the value of their contributions before him sometimes somebody
[567.2s - 572.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: owns none of the token um but they they're like the number one like person in the community
[572.8s - 577.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: somehow and then sometimes someone owns a lot of the token but has like no
[581.3s - 587.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: kind of like landed on a system like this is basically saying hey this needs to be coordinated
[587.4s - 594.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: through the incentives somehow and what's the simplest set of incentives that solves for one
[594.0s - 600.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: coordinating all the bigger holders in the community and the group to come together in a more
[603.0s - 606.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Two, all the people who have distribution to those people,
[606.4s - 608.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: what makes them selfishly want to act,
[608.4s - 612.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: even if they don't have or hold a bunch of the token?
[612.8s - 615.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And then three, how do we make this token feel like
[615.5s - 620.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: as legitimate and as official as possible using the above?
[621.0s - 624.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: and then but the main reason for one and two is not to make it feel official it's
[624.4s - 629.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: more to make it successful like basically the the idea here is that if there's not
[629.0s - 632.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: some group of people with like a huge amount of skin in the game and normally these would be like
[632.9s - 638.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: the token launcher but in this case the the literal launcher like the person who pushed the button and
[638.3s - 646.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: bought the first round of coins the problem is that person in our previous model may have nothing at all to do with the
[647.3s - 652.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: just be seen as like a hostile actor to a lot of the people that are part of that actual
[652.0s - 652.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: token community, right?
[653.0s - 656.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: If some random guy goes and launches GigaChad who doesn't hold any GigaChad, has nothing
[656.9s - 661.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: to do with the GigaChad community, that token is going to be in a tricky place right off
[661.1s - 661.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: the bat.
[663.5s - 669.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So that's what this system was made to facilitate, and then, you know, the DBAs.
[667.0s - 673.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: facilitate and then you know the details around like why i have a mistake and stuff it's it's more
[673.2s - 679.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: around to make sure that they're actually holding it at the time the token launches where we take a
[679.0s - 685.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: snapshot and then and then we what we then spend time with other people who've done a bunch of token
[685.6s - 690.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: launches and they're like you guys shouldn't be giving a claim to all the people who hold the
[690.0s - 693.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: will hold the parent token because the amount's going to be way too small.
[693.7s - 698.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: They're like, we have a million holders, and if you give a claim to everybody, all these
[698.3s - 701.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: million holders, and even if this token's worth 100 million and you give 10% of it,
[701.6s - 709.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: you give 10 million to a million holders, $10 million to a million holders, you're giving
[709.8s - 712.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: them very, very little money.
[712.2s - 715.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: A lot of them won't even be excited about that.
[713.0s - 719.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: of them won't even be excited about that so and that's the best case scenario but with the time
[719.1s - 723.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: they're claiming it's going to be far less and then on top of this the question is how do you
[723.5s - 727.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: incentivize these people to actually go make the token succeed so that's what this sort of
[727.8s - 733.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: unlocking um situation is about is we can't we can't stop anyone who bought on the
[733.5s - 738.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: fair the open um public sale from trading
[736.0s - 742.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: um public sale from trading but these people who get these tokens um they can be incentivized via
[742.9s - 747.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: having a lockup because they got their tokens for free that can be changed based on certain
[747.6s - 751.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: milestones being hit the most obvious one being market cap because that means they've been driving
[751.7s - 757.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: the success of the token in some some way or another so i'm hoping it's not too complicated
[757.4s - 761.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: but basically what this is a recognition is that where we can't we can't solve the
[759.0s - 762.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: is that we can't solve these problems in business development.
[762.2s - 763.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: We have to solve them with incentives.
[764.7s - 767.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And the simplest system is maybe a combination of these things.
[768.0s - 771.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And so now it's just like figuring out how to make sure that the UI and everything else
[771.2s - 771.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: isn't too complicated.
[773.3s - 773.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[773.7s - 782.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: A couple of things that I wanted to bring up is what was, well, we went over this with
[782.0s - 788.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: architect and they they suggested and they're going to make a recommendation that the what
[788.2s - 796.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: percentage of this of the market cap or the fdb be relative to the actual size so that if you have
[796.7s - 802.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: a coin like bitcoin you're not going to expect to get five percent of bitcoin's market cap
[802.4s - 807.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: but if it's i don't know ian coin then you definitely need to pull five percent
[805.0s - 811.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: definitely need to pull 5%. So they're going to propose a sliding scale for how that would
[811.8s - 818.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: work. How do they react to that idea overall? They like it, actually. And the other thing
[818.2s - 823.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: that I'm not sure if you put it in here, but it's necessary is it can't be FDB anyway.
[823.1s - 827.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: It has to be percentage of circulating supply. This is kind of the feedback that we heard
[827.3s - 830.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: from people with large tokens. So for mean coins, circulating supply,
[828.0s - 833.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: large tokens so for mean coins circulating supply is often the whole supply but um for instance
[833.7s - 839.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: jupiter is going to launch one of these with us and jupiter is a top three or four solana token
[839.0s - 843.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: and a huge amount of their tokens are still being earned or locked for some other reason right and
[843.6s - 853.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: that's how most protocol tokens are so yeah they were saying like hey we usually get like 12% of
[851.0s - 856.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: to participate in in governance so like five percent seems reasonable but five percent of
[856.8s - 858.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: the whole supply would be way too much
[858.8s - 867.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: but again we can get that number from like the index apis we're using so it shouldn't be a
[867.5s - 871.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: problem we have to make sure that we use that specifically
[871.3s - 876.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: um
[874.0s - 884.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So, David, basically what this allows for is it's permissionless, it could be chaotic,
[884.9s - 891.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: it allows communities to rally, and then the referral program is just like, hey, it's
[891.1s - 892.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: pretty simple, you can't civil attack it.
[893.2s - 899.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: If you bring in people who stake this token, then you're getting...
[897.0s - 902.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: and then you're getting some portion of the launcher rewards too.
[902.0s - 904.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So that just like what we saw with Telegram,
[904.0s - 907.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: we can have a bunch of people spreading the word about these game point launches,
[907.0s - 911.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: even if they don't hold any themselves just to pump up the community.
[911.0s - 914.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Or in some cases, like we know the guy that runs the peanut,
[914.0s - 917.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: you know, the squirrel game, meme coin channel.
[917.0s - 921.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And we know people that run a bunch of channels and they can share the referral links.
[920.0s - 926.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: share the referral links so they're incentivized to actually get people in and also like you
[926.6s - 930.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: know scott was trying to just figure out how much to pay them and it's impossible like we don't even
[930.7s - 935.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: really know how effective each of these channels are so this just gets everyone paid fairly based
[935.5s - 945.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: on what they they brought in so the that
[943.0s - 952.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: that the referral link what are what are they linking i mean i know they're just signing up
[952.5s - 959.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: uh having a the essentially the the privy account so no it's not it's not a referral to create an
[959.6s - 968.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: account but that doesn't get us anything it's a very specific referral link to stake it's like a
[966.0s - 971.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: pro link to stake the coins to launch that particular token okay the usd value of any
[971.7s - 977.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: okay and then they're getting credit for the amount that person staked so you can't civil
[977.2s - 980.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: attack it because we're not looking at how many accounts they brought in we don't care
[980.5s - 986.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: it's just purely like how many if you brought this many this many dollars worth or sorry this
[986.8s - 991.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: percentage of uh giga chat to be staked against
[989.0s - 994.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: GigaChat to be staked against the GigaChat GameCoin launch, then you get credit for that amount.
[994.0s - 999.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So we're disproportionately rewarding them for bringing in whales,
[999.0s - 1002.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: and they don't get anything for bringing in people that don't contribute anything.
[1002.0s - 1006.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So we don't need to worry about any civil attack.
[1006.0s - 1009.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: That makes sense.
[1012.0s - 1018.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: okay so yeah yeah the hope is here is you'd see people go around hunting down
[1013.0s - 1014.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[1018.2s - 1023.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: folders of this figuring out how to get in chats and pushing for this and some of them you know
[1023.9s - 1028.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: this is this would be a way to like get the communities um organically viral around each
[1028.5s - 1037.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: point and then instead of giving 10 to everybody we don't give anything to the
[1035.0s - 1040.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: community anymore we give 20 to this launcher crew so these people have like a very big bag
[1040.9s - 1046.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: in this and then i think we didn't answer ian was like who actually launches the coin
[1046.2s - 1053.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: by launchers though you're we're talking about the people that uh i guess these stakers these
[1053.3s - 1060.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: launch stakers stakers and refers yeah because like there's one pool that they all get the rewards out
[1062.9s - 1068.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: but it's locked up until they hit certain milestones on the market cap side.
[1068.7s - 1071.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So not only do they own a bunch of it, but they're the legit community.
[1071.4s - 1075.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: They're the people who actually got the community in, where are the community?
[1075.4s - 1080.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: They own more than token than probably anybody else, but they can only get their quick unlocks
[1080.1s - 1083.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: to sell it by hitting certain market caps.
[1081.0s - 1088.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: certain market caps. That's the idea around how this launch mechanism works.
[1088.0s - 1100.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Okay. Yeah. I guess Architect mentioned it. Scott, I mentioned it's, like, Dave, or more
[1100.0s - 1106.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Scott was, like, hasn't people want to connect their wallets at all? So, Architect had recommended,
[1104.0s - 1109.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: architect had recommended like something token proof like to prove that you have it but
[1109.9s - 1113.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: but i i searched and i couldn't find anything that exists like that did you find anything
[1113.8s - 1119.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: did they have a recommendation they didn't have a recommendation yeah so scott's just funding this
[1119.1s - 1123.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: for like the last three days so the initial resistance from scott to this is that he went
[1123.8s - 1126.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: and made a bunch of deals with all these different people they're all just these
[1126.6s - 1129.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: random arbitrary deals like oh the lady took the picture
[1127.0s - 1130.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Like, oh, the lady who took the picture of GigaChad should get, like, 0.3%.
[1130.0s - 1131.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And it's like, why?
[1131.0s - 1134.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And it's like, I don't know, because I chatted with her, and that's what happened.
[1134.0s - 1137.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So it's just, like, he has to unwind these.
[1137.0s - 1139.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So that was the first point of resistance.
[1139.0s - 1141.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And then he was like, oh, they're never going to go for it.
[1141.0s - 1144.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And then he had the conversations, and they pretty much were on board for it.
[1144.0s - 1149.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Because what I told him was, like, look, if someone backs off of promoting the token
[1149.0s - 1152.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: after you have come up with a system where there's a referral structure,
[1153.2s - 1159.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: faith that they can actually deliver value to what we're doing because if you did um the way
[1159.6s - 1164.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: this works actually they can get way more of the token than in the previous structure so for anyone
[1164.1s - 1168.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: who's like hey i wish scott gave me like a one percent instead of 0.3 percent because i have the
[1168.5s - 1172.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: best channel well then now they can get one percent because they'll just drive a ton of referrals
[1172.1s - 1175.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: and so now they have way more upside so
[1173.0s - 1178.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: so now they have way more upside so basically if people bow out it's because they they probably
[1178.5s - 1184.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: have doubts about their ability to draw real value in which case we we dodged a bullet um anyway that
[1184.0s - 1188.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: went over better than he thought but then there's a second part of just of course people with and by
[1188.5s - 1192.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: the way i don't think this has come from like whales it came from people suspecting other
[1192.1s - 1198.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: people would feel this way which is um uh not directly from the people but people
[1200.7s - 1207.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: might be scared about connecting their wallet um if if like you know it has a large bag in one of
[1207.6s - 1214.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: these things like which um is understandable but they have to do this for airdrop claims all the
[1214.4s - 1221.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: time currently so my response to that is like instead of being um like yeah
[1220.0s - 1228.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Like, instead of literally reinventing the wheel here, like we should go figure out what people do for Solana claims where you're, you're, you need to be a holder of a token.
[1229.5s - 1240.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Like, this is a beyond solved problem. So I guess, Damon, for you, that's, that's an engineering question. And, um, product then, Ian, for you too. So like, we should just go figure that out.
[1241.1s - 1244.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I'll try to find coins that have done that. I don't know if you know.
[1242.0s - 1246.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: that have done that I don't know if you know one of one off the top of your head I mean yeah not
[1246.7s - 1251.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: air because the thing is it's not for airdrops so it's yeah it's just for claims and but I mean
[1251.4s - 1257.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: there must be there must be tons I mean it's communities doing cross cross marketing with
[1257.7s - 1264.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: with a claim is like a very common thing so that to me it's like there's got to be a way of doing
[1264.4s - 1267.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: this because this is such a common tactic that
[1270.6s - 1272.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And so token proof is an EVM only thing.
[1272.8s - 1277.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I'm not sure that we should even bother with token proof on the EVM version of this, Damon,
[1277.7s - 1278.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: to be completely honest with you.
[1278.9s - 1283.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I just, well, all we're doing is having someone stake.
[1283.5s - 1285.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And so maybe what it comes down to is just really good messaging.
[1286.6s - 1290.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Like it's right to flag that it has to feel safe, but like,
[1288.0s - 1293.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: that it has to feel safe but like what the thing i've always been trying to point out to scott is
[1293.3s - 1299.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: that token proof is just yet another third party that can also cause more security surface area
[1299.4s - 1304.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: on your wallet and like it's not necessarily more secure you're just trusting another person or
[1304.5s - 1313.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: another company to hopefully not have any security issues and so it's like it's a if you're connecting
[1311.0s - 1315.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: it's a if you're connecting to a bad source then you're you're going to get drained and if you
[1315.7s - 1321.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: trust us then you shouldn't necessarily feel better about having token proof integrated than
[1321.5s - 1326.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: just connecting with us so it's kind of a weird thing where it's like i just think we need to be
[1326.0s - 1331.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: a trusted brand and that means we need to have good messaging and we need to explain what you're
[1331.9s - 1336.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: doing and why you shouldn't worry and and then we'll just deal with it
[1334.0s - 1339.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: and then we'll just deal with it as it happens but my sense is if the claim is good enough then
[1339.6s - 1344.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: the then people will do it and if the claim is is crap like because we were giving everybody
[1344.2s - 1349.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: a million users a claim of a tiny piece of the token then yeah probably we'd have more trouble
[1349.4s - 1354.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: so anyway let's let's figure out what's out there for solana and if it turns out people
[1354.9s - 1359.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: just connect their wallet in yolo then we should just do that instead of spinning our wheels on
[1357.0s - 1362.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: instead of spinning our wheels on trying to invent something new yeah because the staking
[1362.8s - 1370.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: we will be holding their token their their base coin which i would assume well i mean
[1370.9s - 1379.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: we would have to build that but i don't know i mean huh do we though like i thought that's what
[1379.1s - 1382.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: is well it is staking
[1381.0s - 1385.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Well, it is staking is is yeah, holding is locking up their tokens. But
[1386.0s - 1397.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I'm this is I mean, honestly, like, I don't know, like, isn't it possible for them to stake against some sort of other Solana staking contract that we just like doesn't need to even be our contract or does it even matter?
[1400.0s - 1405.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: It's a good question. What are you saying?
[1403.0s - 1412.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I guess if we don't care about the I mean do we care about the the value that
[1412.7s - 1416.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: these guys would lock into the you know the lock value that they would provide
[1416.1s - 1422.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: because if we do then that limits the solutions that we can think of right you
[1422.1s - 1426.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: mean do we want to get yield on whatever they lock up or just to be able to say
[1426.0s - 1428.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: hey our protocol our protocol is
[1426.0s - 1430.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: hey our protocol our protocol is now worth five percent of gigas you know
[1430.9s - 1440.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: oh that's the TVL yeah do we want credit for the TVL I you know it's funny
[1440.8s - 1445.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: because like a year ago everybody wanted credit for TVL now now after the Barra
[1445.1s - 1449.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: chain and other chains pumping these numbers and then the TVL ultimately
[1449.0s - 1453.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: the TVL ultimately meaning nothing. Everyone's really backed off that metric. I'm not sure if you've been
[1449.9s - 1451.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: meaning nothing like everyone
[1453.0s - 1457.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: seeing these conversations, but basically it got game so hard that it
[1457.0s - 1461.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: seems to be a useful indicator.
[1461.0s - 1465.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: It means something, but it doesn't mean much after everyone started gaming it, so I'm not really
[1465.0s - 1469.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: sure if it matters that much. Okay, so all that matters is that you're able to prove that
[1469.0s - 1474.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: you have that balance at the time of
[1472.0s - 1477.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: that balance at the time of talking about that's not to say that that we shouldn't it's just like
[1477.3s - 1482.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: if there's a way that created a lot more trust that everybody knew about then then then i don't
[1482.7s - 1486.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: then the trade is worth it if we go through all the trouble of using some other random staking
[1486.6s - 1490.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: contract and nobody gave a damn either way then we're just being dumb you know what i mean if we
[1490.6s - 1495.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: can get the tvl it's like conversion rate thing if people don't care if it's our contractor or
[1495.0s - 1498.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: tracker or somebody else's, then we should take the TVL.
[1498.6s - 1502.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: If we think there's going to be a 10 times better conversion rate or 2x better conversion
[1502.7s - 1507.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: rate on some known, trusted contract, then maybe we sacrifice the TVL.
[1507.9s - 1510.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So I don't feel like I'm in a position to make that call until you guys actually know
[1510.7s - 1512.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: what the options are.
[1516.6s - 1517.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[1518.0s - 1541.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Cool, and then, Ian, you created that proof of humanity, human proof doc, I don't understand
[1519.6s - 1520.0s] Unknown Speaker: Okay.
[1541.0s - 1549.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: understand that a little better of human proof rewards gating i guess it just gates the usd claim
[1549.3s - 1555.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: well just any claims uh here let me share the screen
[1555.0s - 1566.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: like basically is you get to the claim to the claim page uh and it's like okay you have this much in
[1564.0s - 1572.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: And it's like, okay, you have this much in rewards, but you can only withdraw five until
[1572.5s - 1576.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: you do the big one.
[1576.5s - 1589.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I haven't looked through that documentation and the resources yet, I guess what I need
[1587.0s - 1595.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: what i need to look through and and just i guess my concern before i even look through it is just
[1595.1s - 1601.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: what's that ux flow because you know we've also talked about you know trying to do this as
[1601.1s - 1607.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: seamless as possible l3 type of stuff so it feels friction and so but i mean but it just
[1607.1s - 1612.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: also seems useful so it's like and it's all i mean it everything
[1610.0s - 1617.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: so i mean everything here is it's already out of the box like we already have privy and privy has
[1617.2s - 1625.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: integration with airship so if we give them our airship token they can verify people's
[1625.5s - 1635.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: phones did it i know less it's a like like it is a widget or a process that they
[1633.0s - 1640.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Widget or a process that they own so I don't know I'm not sure yet whether they would have to do it outside of our app
[1641.4s - 1644.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Of our dApp or or if they can do it all from inside
[1647.3s - 1649.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Right, yeah, exactly
[1653.6s - 1658.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: So I'll I'll need to review this more closely I
[1658.0s - 1661.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: Hang on, let me go, we'll check.
[1661.0s - 1667.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Because that was exactly my concern, is like, you're in the DAP in particular.
[1667.0s - 1674.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we solved for making sure, you know, Privy's working,
[1674.0s - 1679.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: but then there's this other embedded layer, potentially.
[1679.0s - 1681.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[1679.0s - 1685.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: yeah and i miss i somehow didn't write it down but architect i think may have mentioned that
[1685.6s - 1691.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: like uh probably a bunch of these players would never do the kyc part or don't means to do it
[1691.0s - 1696.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: something like that i didn't yeah i mean that's that's like that's the that's like the reason
[1696.0s - 1704.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: that you do it right yeah that's like that's like if you enforce people to buy tickets at the near
[1706.4s - 1713.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: it's like uh yeah yeah anyway it's just like literally just the inverse it's saying the
[1713.0s - 1718.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: inverse of what we're saying which is we don't want some people to be claiming yeah don't want
[1718.3s - 1727.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: to jump the stalls well so the real thing is yeah there's praying one way it's like
[1725.0s - 1729.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: thing is yeah there's brain one way it's like that hey you'll have less players and so that's
[1729.1s - 1732.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: one way of looking at it and then the other way of looking at it is that the people who are real
[1732.7s - 1738.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: players will actually earn a more reasonable amount and that you'll build like a real audience
[1738.4s - 1745.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: that actually is cares and can turn into real customers for these games instead of just bots
[1745.5s - 1748.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: right so that's i about customers
[1748.0s - 1756.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: customers.
[1748.6s - 1750.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: yeah
[1756.0s - 1761.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Cool.
[1761.0s - 1766.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I'm not sure if you want to cover anything. I just gave you the update on
[1766.0s - 1773.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: engineering, so I can go over it again if you like.
[1771.0s - 1778.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Are you talking to me here, Damon?
[1778.0s - 1781.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: To you, Justin.
[1781.0s - 1786.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Yeah, look.
[1786.0s - 1790.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So just to give you guys an update, Damon, now that you're back, there's actually like
[1790.0s - 1794.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: two projects that are launching some game launchpad-like things at the end of June that
[1794.0s - 1796.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I've been made aware of.
[1794.0s - 1800.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I've been made aware of. So, I think the clock is actually kind of ticking for us in the sense that
[1800.2s - 1803.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: we should really be sprinting to get this thing out in the next two weeks.
[1804.4s - 1807.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And then if that meant like cutting some of the scope we're talking about here, I think we should
[1807.9s - 1812.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: do it. I don't think we can really cut on the launching piece. I think the KYC part is
[1812.7s - 1819.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: really important. Like, I basically don't think that we're ever going to have anything
[1821.6s - 1828.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: without some form of step up of kyc but there might be a way of launching without it um the
[1828.9s - 1832.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: problem is if if trading takes off like it has for some of these other launch pads then
[1832.8s - 1837.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: then like it's you know you could very quickly get into a place where like the dollar values
[1837.1s - 1842.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: are pretty big and then incentive for people to be farming is is high and
[1840.0s - 1846.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: to be farming is is high and yeah you could have a bunch of players but you won't but everybody
[1846.6s - 1852.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: will be earning opinions and um we'll have a bunch of random bots on twitter complaining that
[1852.6s - 1860.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: they they weren't able to claim or whatever so the the one to watch on this is watch
[1860.0s - 1865.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: coin the 10k app he relaunched today this morning um at pacific time
[1863.0s - 1868.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: this morning um at pacific time what was it now they made it so any creator can do it so this is
[1868.7s - 1875.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: that guy uh i mentioned him a few weeks ago the app was called 10k oh yeah i shared it a while
[1875.7s - 1881.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: ago he relaunched so first he launched and then he had a huge civil attack problem so he had
[1881.0s - 1888.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: forty thousand dollars of the app but he had 250 000 wallets playing the watch to earn rewards so
[1886.0s - 1893.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: earned rewards so somehow five or five or six x people watching and claiming watch rewards and
[1893.7s - 1900.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: even have the app um and then he also had issues with like the way people complaining about
[1900.9s - 1907.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: the like the fact that they had to pay anything to claim or whatever and he was using ata's like
[1907.9s - 1911.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: us the same cost and a lot of people were pretty annoyed about it because like
[1912.3s - 1917.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: and then he was thinking about whether or not he covers some of those fees himself but like that's
[1917.4s - 1922.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: why there's there's stuff we can learn from from these launches but i don't obviously we'll learn
[1922.9s - 1934.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: faster by being out but we'll also learn very well by taking attention to what people are doing and
[1932.0s - 1945.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: The other change I was made aware of today was the pairing with Sol and then later the OG token.
[1945.0s - 1949.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: We had had that version at one point.
[1949.0s - 1957.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: And then so something maybe more engineering thing potentially to solve for is
[1955.0s - 1964.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: to solve for is the players still want we need to reward them with that base coin and so just
[1964.3s - 1970.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: and so there has to be this swap that happened well that is not new david because we were never
[1970.3s - 1980.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: trading the um the base token for the g token once it was graduated right it was only the
[1978.0s - 1985.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: set to be we just never talked about the swap part but the the og token pair just just so we
[1985.2s - 1990.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: never ever had a version of this where like trump was trading with g trump or not in the last few
[1990.9s - 2003.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: months that that was that was the post-graduation situation really no it was just the bottom curve
[2001.0s - 2005.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: No, it was just the Botnik curve, but we've just never gotten far enough along in building
[2005.4s - 2006.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: what we're building to realize that.
[2007.4s - 2009.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I mean, Ian, you built the charts, right?
[2010.2s - 2010.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Yes.
[2012.1s - 2017.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: The charts had said, the tier charts were OG, OG Trump, OG G Trump, right?
[2017.5s - 2018.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Yep, and now we...
[2018.8s - 2019.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: That hasn't changed.
[2019.9s - 2024.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Well, remember, we decided last week to kill it, and now I just make it OG G Trump.
[2024.0s - 2025.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: G-Trump?
[2024.9s - 2026.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Right, we just got...
[2025.0s - 2026.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Right.
[2026.0s - 2027.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: We just got rid of one trading pair.
[2027.0s - 2028.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Correct.
[2028.0s - 2030.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: But we were never trading Trump for G-Trump post-graduation.
[2030.0s - 2031.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: It has never been designed.
[2031.0s - 2032.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Oh, I see what you mean.
[2032.0s - 2033.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Yes.
[2033.0s - 2034.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Yes.
[2034.0s - 2035.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: That's true.
[2035.0s - 2036.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Yeah, right.
[2036.0s - 2037.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Because we always have the dual pool system.
[2037.0s - 2039.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So this swapping has always been a necessity.
[2039.0s - 2044.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: It's just never been acknowledged, is my point.
[2044.0s - 2049.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Well, when it was Trump, G-Trump, even if it was just bonding curve,
[2047.0s - 2054.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: even if it was just bonding curve that that part didn't require a swap in except for post-graduation
[2054.8s - 2060.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: i guess there would have had to been swapping right that's my point is that like the infra
[2060.3s - 2064.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: the infra requirements haven't changed it's just like yeah now you have to do the bottom curve too
[2064.2s - 2072.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: but that's it but it's an important distinction right like we never ever had trump g trump as the
[2070.0s - 2074.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: had Trump to Trump as the trading pair post-graduation pepper.
[2077.4s - 2078.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Right, okay.
[2080.8s - 2086.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: So, yeah, I need to figure out the swap for, in general, now.
[2086.3s - 2095.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: I guess it's very similar in the sense of, in the bonding curve, to me, it's clear, then you swap 10%,
[2098.4s - 2101.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: And then I guess the thing I need to figure out
[2101.8s - 2107.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: is like how periodically do we do that?
[2107.9s - 2110.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Oh yeah, sorry, a little convoluted here.
[2111.5s - 2116.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: The other thing is we have to create that pair as well
[2116.0s - 2124.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: as well, because we would have to make it easier because there already is a sold pair.
[2116.7s - 2118.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: because...
[2124.5s - 2129.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So it's actually easier, we're making, this should make the requirements easier in every
[2129.8s - 2130.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: way.
[2130.8s - 2136.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: You're taking a more liquid pair, there are many pairs to choose from, right?
[2136.7s - 2140.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Before we had a problem of like a pair that was an exotic pair that didn't even really
[2140.3s - 2141.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: exist.
[2140.9s - 2142.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: We're the only people trading it.
[2142.4s - 2144.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And in fact, that would have created a lot of liquidity issues.
[2144.5s - 2148.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Now we're just taking Sol and trading it for Trump, which is one of the biggest trading
[2148.6s - 2149.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: pairs on Solana.
[2149.8s - 2150.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Right.
[2150.4s - 2155.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Ian, so I actually had said Justin's point right here earlier, but Bruce was saying it
[2155.7s - 2160.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: needs to be this other, the B2 pair or something.
[2161.1s - 2164.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: I need to clarify.
[2162.0s - 2168.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: need to clarify that with them because i agree with justin that's like hey the pair is already
[2168.6s - 2176.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: there in this case yeah but reese seemed to be thinking it must be this other type of pair
[2176.2s - 2181.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: i don't know uh well it sounds like we're all way too confused about what this is in the first
[2181.2s - 2187.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: place that i'm pointing out four months in that there's never been a trump g trump trading pair
[2185.0s - 2189.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: never been a trump g trump trading pair it was in he and his graph like i'm not making this
[2189.7s - 2195.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: shit up and i'm the only one that's not writing code or making these graphs it's it's just
[2195.4s - 2201.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: conceptually we got stuck in the last you say to the the other paradigm but it's always been
[2201.0s - 2206.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: the dual pool system right well yeah but the dual pool but this is the discussion you and i had even
[2206.1s - 2210.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: last week which is the dual pool has nothing to do with changing the quote okay remember christopher
[2208.0s - 2212.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: changing the quote token remember because for a while like people were suggesting it did and then
[2212.6s - 2217.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: i was like does it and then and then i wanted to dig in not to be pedantic but i there's i i don't
[2217.9s - 2222.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: like when people create associations between things where there aren't because not about like
[2222.6s - 2227.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: who changed what but but then we start getting like the wrong understanding of the system
[2227.0s - 2233.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: um so yeah changing the quote token has nothing to do with removing one of the quote uh with one
[2231.0s - 2234.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: removing one of the, quote, one of the graduation goals.
[2234.7s - 2238.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: They're just two totally distinct separate decisions that happen to happen around the
[2238.1s - 2242.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: same time, but they literally, they're not connected in any way or shape.
[2251.3s - 2254.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So, yeah, everything we're doing is making this simpler and easier.
[2254.0s - 2259.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: and easier this is actually a decision made in part to speed up the ability to do this because
[2259.4s - 2263.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: what we've heard time and time again is oh we can't support these types of tokens oh i have
[2263.9s - 2268.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: to ask them for this feature oh and so my my thing was like okay well like actually you know what i
[2268.9s - 2273.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: think it's probably a big mistake to be doing the quote token in the meme coin anyway they've been
[2273.5s - 2279.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: telling us that for a long time and even if we got them to support all these features and even
[2277.0s - 2280.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: all these features and even if we built all these things so what it saves us a swap on the bonding
[2280.8s - 2284.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: curve but the bonding curve is going to be barely any of the trading for something like trump that's
[2284.4s - 2288.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: completely you know and then by the way it saves us like some engineering time it's like the worst
[2288.6s - 2294.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: cost for reason to to do anything when in fact like the liquidity of the whole thing would be
[2294.1s - 2302.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: screwed up and the problem with the tokenomics in general which i suggested so i'll take 100 of the
[2300.0s - 2306.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: blame for this is is that people would have to be selling trump to buy g trump which is negative
[2306.3s - 2312.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: pressure on the trump price anyway so it's not something you it's actually bad tokenomics from
[2312.3s - 2318.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: the eyes of the the community not not good and so in in the other case that we're in now actually
[2318.6s - 2325.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: we're creating only buying pressure because we're we're coming in to buy the rewards but we're we're
[2323.1s - 2326.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: We're never asking people to sell Trump to buy our token.
[2326.8s - 2328.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So this is just better in every way.
[2328.6s - 2330.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: It's a way easier to implement on the engineering side.
[2330.6s - 2332.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: It's the same way that every other token launchpad works.
[2333.2s - 2335.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: It doesn't run into any of the three or four issues that we found
[2335.8s - 2339.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: dealing with the sort of small prices and whatever that they mean,
[2339.5s - 2341.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: quite the price volatility or anything else.
[2341.2s - 2344.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And then we got rid of a liquidity pool so that we could have the same
[2344.4s - 2345.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: graduation as everybody else.
[2345.6s - 2348.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So the way I'm looking at this now,
[2348.8s - 2353.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: now we're just running a standard run-of-the-mill Meteora launch pad,
[2354.4s - 2355.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: quote traded in the same thing,
[2355.9s - 2358.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: except we're holding some supply to reward people on games.
[2359.0s - 2361.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: That's the way I'm looking at this now is we just cut a bunch of scope.
[2363.1s - 2364.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: I do agree with that.
[2364.3s - 2367.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: And when I saw that and I was like, okay, great.
[2367.9s - 2371.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Cause I know that was like, we were trying to bug Meteora.
[2369.0s - 2376.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: trying to bug New York to like have that where we could support Trump G Trump on the bonding
[2376.3s - 2382.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: curve and then even getting any of these like trading views it's like well we we'd have to do
[2382.8s - 2388.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: like these like two layers of it essentially it's not just the straightforward normal call so when
[2388.5s - 2394.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: it's just the this pair with soul that makes several areas easier and
[2392.0s - 2397.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: makes several areas easier so i thought that was great news in that regard yeah so it should be
[2397.4s - 2401.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: easier in like every regard so now i guess what i'm saying is i'm just expecting things to go
[2401.9s - 2405.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: really smoothly and quickly because this is just like every other partner they're working with now
[2407.7s - 2411.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: like we shouldn't be blocked on on anything at this point now this is just
[2411.4s - 2417.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: like every other random person is creating a launch pad
[2415.0s - 2436.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: and by the way i think it's better like i think we were probably making a huge mistake
[2436.0s - 2440.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: with that other design anyway and that's on me but yeah we never finished implementing
[2438.0s - 2442.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: on me but yeah we never finished implementing it so it's not like we're throwing out much work we
[2442.0s - 2446.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: just spent a lot of time thinking about it and slowing down and now we're trying to make it
[2446.4s - 2453.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: simpler so yeah that's that's the the long and short of that is like it should be very easy
[2453.0s - 2463.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: to build this design and having to write one spawn function is good
[2461.0s - 2486.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Cool. I'm messaging Bruce now just so I make sure he's understanding as well in a warp on missing something what he was saying about the pair pairing because we regardless we need to use that the current
[2487.1s - 2500.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: well yeah because with the dbc and with dmmv2 you can take these and only the vote token if you want
[2500.1s - 2504.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: which means that before he was planning on taking these from both and i saw some recent discussion
[2504.8s - 2509.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: where he was still asking about whether he could take from both so i don't think he totally
[2507.0s - 2512.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: both so i don't think he totally gets what we're doing um but you'd only want to take in the quote
[2512.5s - 2518.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: token because you'd only want to swap soul if he is taking in both if that's why he's he's still
[2518.8s - 2522.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: asking to have that trading pair that would make sense because if he's taking fees in g trump
[2522.8s - 2527.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: and in soul then you need the way to turn the g trump into trump but we're only supposed to be
[2527.3s - 2532.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: taking fees in the quote token now so you should that should be the part that you remind people
[2530.0s - 2537.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: be the part that you remind him of yeah because i've asked him that his last answer was that we
[2537.2s - 2546.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: get both like like we get that's part of greece's design because the bamb2 by default is only fees
[2546.5s - 2551.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: in the quote token and there's a discussion in the telegram thread where where he's like hey
[2551.7s - 2555.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: can i have it in both and they're like why do you want that and he's like i need it
[2557.7s - 2562.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: i think bruce is now out of sync with what you want he's literally asking them to get fees in
[2562.6s - 2566.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: both and then telling you he's getting them both but i don't think we have any reason to be taking
[2566.0s - 2578.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: the feasible anymore i think we want all the fees to be in soul or og i agree
[2576.0s - 2588.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[2588.0s - 2590.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So can one of you guys message Rhys about that?
[2590.0s - 2592.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Because I think he's just confused.
[2592.0s - 2594.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I think that's probably where the confusion is coming from.
[2594.0s - 2601.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: He still thinks that we want these involved for some reason.
[2599.0s - 2603.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm doing that right now.
[2603.0s - 2604.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Excuse me?
[2604.0s - 2606.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: I'm just about finished writing a message.
[2606.0s - 2607.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Ah.
[2619.0s - 2621.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Pick them directly as well.
[2621.0s - 2622.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[2622.0s - 2624.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: I've messaged them.
[2622.0s - 2647.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: A message now.
[2645.0s - 2655.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Okay, any other things I had on my list?
[2658.7s - 2661.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: I covered my immediate questions.
[2667.4s - 2670.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So what's the next milestone?
[2668.0s - 2672.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So what's the next milestone we're going for in the next couple of days?
[2672.0s - 2678.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Like I want to keep it really tight and like I want to reiterate what I said before,
[2678.0s - 2683.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: there's two projects that are launching at the end of this month that are not exactly what we're doing,
[2683.0s - 2686.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: but they're close enough that they're going to cause really big problems for us as they go out first.
[2686.0s - 2693.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Yeah, so for us it really is, let's finish the voting session.
[2691.0s - 2700.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Let's finish the voting cycle and the reward cycle, of course, and harden the staking and the swapping.
[2700.0s - 2706.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: But once we get that, we should be ready to go, right?
[2706.0s - 2711.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Like, there's a lot of other stuff, but the minimum loop is serviced with that.
[2713.0s - 2716.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And when does that land?
[2728.2s - 2730.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: We're not waiting on Meteora for anything now, right?
[2732.3s - 2733.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Well, yes.
[2733.9s - 2739.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Breeze got an answer from Meteora for how to do the...
[2737.0s - 2744.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: for how to do the the the estimation they gave him a new tool for that but
[2744.6s - 2748.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: according to him it's not working reliably and sometimes it doesn't mean
[2748.8s - 2752.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: are we blocked or is Brees just looking for example code because he's having
[2752.2s - 2756.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: trouble doing something like they're not missing a feature are they because now
[2756.4s - 2759.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: we're just doing whatever other people have already released that's what I
[2759.0s - 2762.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: don't get I asked him the same question and
[2760.0s - 2766.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I asked him the same question and his answer, his answer is he believes they're not like
[2766.2s - 2769.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: they're doing it by hand in the background, which I told him like, that's not, that's
[2769.8s - 2770.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: not an answer.
[2770.8s - 2771.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: What does that mean?
[2771.8s - 2772.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Yeah, exactly.
[2772.8s - 2776.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: This is every time I've gotten that we've had a moment like this with Bruce, it's because
[2776.4s - 2780.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: he just doesn't understand something yet and then he comes to understand it later.
[2780.7s - 2785.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So anyway, they've been very much like working with him on everything.
[2783.0s - 2789.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: working with him on everything I just it just sounds like we don't understand what we're
[2789.2s - 2794.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: we're doing but my my my top down take here of not understanding the smart contracts is that
[2794.2s - 2798.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: we are now releasing a launchpad that does the same things with the same tokens that any other
[2798.5s - 2808.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: launchpad does and so I can't see a reason how or why we would be blocked and so any any feeling of
[2806.0s - 2810.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: any feeling of us being blocked is probably a misunderstanding of the requirements or
[2810.7s - 2816.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: a misunderstanding of Meteor's APIs because at this point we're just doing what everyone
[2816.1s - 2817.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: else does.
[2817.1s - 2831.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Okay, so Brice's point that he was saying earlier to me was not about the sole base
[2829.0s - 2839.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: game coin or not the sole base coin but the um og base coin like who creates that liquidity pair
[2839.1s - 2846.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: yeah so the answer is us um when the og token is launched we won't be creating
[2846.4s - 2854.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: all of these will be the the tokens will all switch to og instead of sold right there's two
[2852.0s - 2857.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: right there's two answers to this question one is when the og tokens already launched
[2857.2s - 2861.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: how will your game point launch happen well the the quote won't be in soul anymore the quote will
[2861.9s - 2866.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: be in og and then we will create the liquidity pool for the og pair and we'll never create the
[2866.7s - 2877.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: liquidity pool for the for the soul pair that makes sense right as part of the and then there's a
[2879.2s - 2880.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: that launch in Seoul
[2880.0s - 2881.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: how do we migrate those
[2881.9s - 2882.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: in OG
[2882.3s - 2885.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: post OG token launch
[2885.0s - 2886.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: and that's an ops
[2886.9s - 2887.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I mean there's some
[2887.7s - 2888.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: engineering stuff
[2888.3s - 2889.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: but it's mostly ops
[2889.3s - 2892.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: and yeah
[2892.9s - 2893.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: you guys have to come up
[2893.7s - 2894.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: with a plan for that
[2894.4s - 2895.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: like basically
[2895.0s - 2895.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: you can migrate
[2895.9s - 2896.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: liquidity pools
[2896.6s - 2897.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: there's
[2897.1s - 2898.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: there's a
[2898.0s - 2901.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: There's a bunch of stuff out there on how to do this.
[2901.0s - 2910.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So it's just you're going to have to pull liquidity out of the sole pair and start putting liquidity into the OG pair and swap and migrate.
[2913.3s - 2923.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: If our contracts have committed most of the sole liquidity to these sole G-Trump pair, then we can take our liquidity.
[2926.0s - 2931.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: and create a new OG pool that then has the,
[2931.0s - 2936.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: then we are also directing everyone to trade on, basically.
[2941.0s - 2942.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Makes sense to me.
[2942.0s - 2946.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: You don't need new liquidity, but you have to,
[2944.0s - 2951.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: have to that that process of that that is a process that you should you should obviously
[2951.0s - 2957.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: like go get some you know up to speed on like i i haven't done that before i've confirmed with
[2957.1s - 2963.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: several people that it's possible so it's but yeah it's going to be requiring some some level
[2963.4s - 2968.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: permissions on the liquidity pool that we need to make sure we have on engineering side to do this
[2967.0s - 2970.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: engineering side to do this when it's live, which I'm assuming we do because we've
[2968.2s - 2969.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: whenever
[2970.9s - 2975.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: deployed it and we're collecting fees on it. And then, yeah,
[2975.2s - 2978.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: a process of doing this for all the ones that have already launched.
[2981.3s - 2981.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Second.
[2985.5s - 2988.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So it sounds like Breeze is in blot. He's just thinking about the other stuff.
[2990.0s - 2997.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: Correct.
[2991.6s - 2992.0s] Unknown Speaker: Yeah.
[2997.0s - 3008.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[3008.0s - 3015.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: So part of our job
[3013.0s - 3022.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Ian, part of our job is to get a firm date here, because we don't have it right now.
[3022.0s - 3033.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Ian, do you have the new fee structure? Has that been given to Brees, the whole 1%, 1% thing?
[3033.0s - 3038.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: No, I don't have it. In fact, wasn't there a conversation that you two guys had about it?
[3041.0s - 3046.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: we want to do I need to I need to catch no conversation so many wires get
[3046.0s - 3051.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: crossed look look no then the Meteora powers believe and believe is using this
[3051.5s - 3056.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: fee structure Meteora has no opinion about what we want to do they I mean
[3056.2s - 3059.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: they'll give us advice based on launches they've seen but they have no opinion
[3059.0s - 3060.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: about how much fees we charge.
[3061.8s - 3064.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: In terms of what you will hear from people
[3064.9s - 3066.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: is that the amount of fees you charge
[3066.7s - 3068.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: changes based on how much volume
[3068.2s - 3069.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: and how big a token gets.
[3070.5s - 3072.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So what I was saying last week
[3072.4s - 3074.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: is that you can't model
[3074.1s - 3076.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: that we would continue to have 2% fees
[3076.9s - 3079.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: all the way up to 100 million market cap
[3079.2s - 3080.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: or a billion market cap.
[3080.4s - 3081.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: That's what I mean.
[3081.3s - 3084.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: That doesn't mean that we wouldn't launch at 2%.
[3082.0s - 3087.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: wouldn't launch at at two percent fees because what happens in practice is every liquidity pool
[3087.5s - 3093.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: is competing against every other liquidity pool for the same pair so if you get to significant
[3093.1s - 3100.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: size and we're like two percent feed and sold g trump is trading with two percent fees at some
[3100.4s - 3107.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: point someone can collect enough g trump and soul to say fuck these guys and then they they go
[3105.5s - 3109.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And then they go and they make their own liquidity pool with 1% fees.
[3109.8s - 3112.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And then a bunch of trading activity goes to their pool.
[3112.7s - 3121.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And then none of those fees are going back to the game developers or to the stakers or to the game players, right?
[3121.5s - 3126.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: It's just a standalone liquidity pool where people are getting this asset and there's no more fees growing back to us.
[3126.2s - 3130.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So what happens in practice is that you have to, again...
[3128.0s - 3133.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: is that you have to again like you have to use ops to manage your liquidity pool to keep the fees
[3133.8s - 3140.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: competitive with the other pools so that you don't lose the trading volume so what they've
[3140.4s - 3144.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: done on certain token launches like trump or something is you have much higher fees in the
[3144.8s - 3148.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: beginning because you can get away with it and like people don't have a lot of options
[3148.4s - 3153.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: then people start collecting a bunch of the token then they start creating their own liquidity pools
[3154.6s - 3161.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: price competitive with everybody else's so you can launch with two percent fees and you can launch
[3161.1s - 3167.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: with one percent fee either way the the terminal sort of like liquidity pool fees tend to go to
[3167.3s - 3176.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: like 0.3 percent or something over time that seems to be where like people go but that's on like a
[3174.0s - 3180.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: a big token right so okay yeah so we have to manage that yeah I did not give
[3180.0s - 3184.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: great breeze that guidance I want to double check the the numbers with
[3184.8s - 3190.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: architect just to get another set of ice and I'll you know share them with you
[3190.4s - 3196.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: and him do you have a meeting with them tomorrow or what's that like with
[3196.6s - 3199.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: architect yeah
[3197.0s - 3198.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[3198.0s - 3204.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I don't have a standing meeting, but Dan and I speak every day.
[3204.0s - 3205.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[3205.0s - 3207.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Yeah, because Believe is doing this.
[3207.0s - 3212.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: We can pass it by Architect, but Believe is the second biggest launchpad now.
[3212.0s - 3216.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And so I'm very comfortable making this decision without talking to them.
[3216.0s - 3218.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I don't think that will object at all.
[3218.0s - 3222.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: They've actually been very, you know, very supportive of all the changes that they've
[3220.0s - 3224.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: you know very supportive of all the changes we've been we've been making so i just want to see
[3224.9s - 3231.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: what they see out there that maybe we don't yeah and there's a recognition here that we need to be
[3231.5s - 3239.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: um we need to be long-term and short-term focused at the same time basically that the model where we
[3239.0s - 3245.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: don't take any fees is a really extreme long-term bet that doesn't de-risk our near-term future if we're
[3243.0s - 3248.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: de-risk our near-term future if we're not collecting money while the sun shines.
[3248.0s - 3256.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So it's like if the market is willing to tolerate 2% fees, 1% going to support the token and
[3256.8s - 3263.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: 1% going to the protocol on the second largest launch pad now on Solana, then we should model
[3263.2s - 3268.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: after that. And then over time, I'm sure we'll get pressure to lower them and then we
[3268.6s - 3271.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: but we should make money while we can make money.
[3271.5s - 3276.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And then later on, we will have to, if the tokens get big,
[3276.1s - 3278.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: the liquidity pool management is kind of a separate thing.
[3278.5s - 3282.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: That's my, you know, I guess we're all pretty new to this,
[3282.5s - 3285.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: but I've been studying up on a lot of that stuff, like, over the weekend,
[3285.7s - 3291.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: and it seems like basically that has nothing to do with our code.
[3289.0s - 3294.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: basically that has nothing to do with our code right that's just like hey how many fees can this
[3294.1s - 3299.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: liquidity pool take is something that we're configuring over time and managing to stay
[3299.1s - 3302.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: competitive so we need to make sure on the engineering side that we have the ability to do
[3302.9s - 3308.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: that but it's like an ops thing it's not going to be automated it's probably going to actually be
[3308.9s - 3314.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: us looking at the liquidity pool that are out there and like manually saying oh shit there's one for
[3312.0s - 3316.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: you only think oh shit there's one for a half a point like we need to go down a half a point
[3316.7s - 3329.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: i hear you so the one launchpad or not launchpad but token experiment last week was loudio
[3329.6s - 3334.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: was the one that everybody that posted and said loudio in their tweet would get
[3334.0s - 3337.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: rewards from this token that was based on the trading
[3338.1s - 3339.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And then what happened was I think they were charging
[3339.7s - 3343.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: like a really high trading fees, like 3%, maybe even more.
[3343.9s - 3345.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And then everybody, or not everybody,
[3345.5s - 3347.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: but some people moved it into liquidity pools
[3347.6s - 3349.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: of their own and cut them out.
[3349.7s - 3352.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So then at some one point I shared the thread,
[3352.0s - 3355.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: but like 85% of the trading volume was happening
[3355.1s - 3356.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: on things that didn't actually pay the people
[3356.6s - 3357.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: who were posting anymore.
[3359.0s - 3360.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So that's the risk.
[3360.0s - 3366.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: If you don't manage your liquidity pool, you could end up in a situation where we're not even making trading fees.
[3366.0s - 3367.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And so we can't pay that.
[3367.0s - 3373.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Well, I mean, we have our supply coming from the token supply, but we're no longer in a position to pay ourselves.
[3373.0s - 3376.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Because we don't make any money from the token supply.
[3376.0s - 3378.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: We only use it to support the token.
[3378.0s - 3381.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So we need the trading fees to stay competitive.
[3381.0s - 3383.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: But it's pretty simple.
[3381.0s - 3385.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: competitive but it's it's pretty simple you just have to keep you have to keep your liquidity pool
[3385.9s - 3390.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: competitive and there is some point where it's like no one's going to go lower than like 0.3%
[3390.8s - 3394.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: or something and it's usually when the tokens become very big and successful so the volume is
[3394.3s - 3398.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: huge so your your absolute dollars that you're making is still pretty big
[3398.1s - 3406.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: so
[3404.0s - 3410.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: what meteor said specifically they really strongly recommended we didn't do was not around fees
[3410.7s - 3416.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: it was around mint rights or something they call it i don't know if you heard about that from briefs
[3416.9s - 3423.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: but that was around the idea your idea like hey can we later allow the token supply to grow
[3423.4s - 3429.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: two years in if we need to yeah and that they said hey like you know
[3427.0s - 3432.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: said hey like you know we could add this if you really want to but you really shouldn't do this
[3432.3s - 3437.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: yeah no one likes it basically because they say you'll get flagged in every dex as a scam coin
[3437.6s - 3443.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: because every token that has mint rights basically gets a big red flag on it and all the top dexes
[3443.6s - 3447.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: so they could give us the ability to do it but we would basically kill our own coin
[3447.6s - 3452.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: because everyone who every trader who looked at it would see it as a scam it'd be flagged
[3462.0s - 3475.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Even if our use case makes sense. So, Ian, I think the thing for you to figure out is, like, how the rewards we talked about is, like, how do we get the rewards going beyond two years then, right?
[3473.0s - 3477.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Do we use some of the trading fees to pay people?
[3477.0s - 3484.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And then if it gets over a certain amount, they get put in the token reserve that can be used to extend the runway?
[3484.0s - 3494.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I mean, the money has to come from somewhere and there's no reserve after the reserve runs out.
[3494.0s - 3498.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Well, you can...
[3496.0s - 3501.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: well but you can you can accrue more to the reserve you can take a more conservative stance
[3501.1s - 3506.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: to preserving the reserve like you could yeah you could say hey you know what wait a second we we
[3506.7s - 3510.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: have like a hundred thousand dollars in trading fees today but really there's barely anybody using
[3510.8s - 3514.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: this thing yet there's only like three devs on here we'd be overpaying them if we gave it all of
[3514.2s - 3519.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: them what if we just not that we're manually um managing it but we came up with some set of rules
[3519.0s - 3522.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: came up with some set of rules we thought were good yeah okay a bunch of this is going back
[3522.4s - 3526.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: into the reward pools to extend the runway of this token
[3526.1s - 3535.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: because damon at some point remember the two years of the rewards from the 25 runs out
[3535.0s - 3539.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: and then we'd only be paying people based on trading fees
[3539.1s - 3544.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: so the question is like do you bank some of your early trading
[3542.0s - 3557.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Do you bank some of your early trading fees to use later, or is that stupid because you're actually making the token less likely to succeed by giving a bunch of the upside that would make it popular in the first place and sending it to a, you know, two years out when 99% of the tokens will be dead?
[3559.8s - 3561.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: It's probably the latter.
[3561.4s - 3567.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So maybe I answered the question, but yeah, probably you want to maximize rewards.
[3565.0s - 3569.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Yeah, probably you want to maximize rewards in the beginning or no one cares.
[3569.0s - 3576.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Yeah, and that idea, you know, there's always the idea of, you know, it doesn't have to
[3576.0s - 3584.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: be, you know, very short periods, but basically having or decreasing the rewards very gradually,
[3584.0s - 3590.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: like how much gets done every day so that it basically never really runs out.
[3590.0s - 3595.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: It's always just constantly getting closer and closer.
[3595.0s - 3599.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: While still keeping the trading fee part just exactly the way it is.
[3599.0s - 3603.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: So in the short term, yeah, people are getting their full chunk of...
[3603.0s - 3608.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Oh, so you want to do halvings where the halvings never really end?
[3608.0s - 3610.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it's one of the suggestions.
[3610.0s - 3613.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, why don't you give the concrete...
[3614.0s - 3615.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I think that's interesting.
[3615.0s - 3616.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[3616.0s - 3617.0s] Unknown Speaker: Yeah.
