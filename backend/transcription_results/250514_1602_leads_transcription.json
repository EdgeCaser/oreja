      "text": "wallet situation we're not going to show or display trump so all those people get screwed so what happens is like long term the way damon was explaining it you have an advantage to play it's going to be in doubt the rewards are going to be in balance so you're getting screwed as a player that just wants to play in our coins in the doge game in the doge wall because you're not getting trump so when i heard this i like freaked out because i'm either not understanding this why are we blocking people from earning tokens that defeats the whole purpose of the protocol the only thing i can think of can you say it again oh yeah so the way that i heard it because now like i'm trying to understand this because we're doing the whole points thing now and this came up when we were trying to design what we needed to give to kai this morning so when you're in a doge game in the doge wallet right you see all these doge games doge game one two three four and i go play them there's a situation where one of those games might actually be tagged with two other tokens however you will not be getting the points for those tokens in the doge game because we're blacklisting blocking whatever word you want to use yeah we covered this in this fall like weeks ago no no do you know the reason for it i know what you're talking about yeah i decided this and we covered it weeks ago so you were in the conversation maybe you didn't get what we were talking about no no we we don't get it so can you explain how it started or why we're doing it yeah it's very simple so like there's a there's a traffic like attribution issue so if you think about it like any game can have any token attached to it right and actually people can attach other tokens to a game after the fact so there's nothing stopping you from taking any random doge game and just adding your shit coin to it like oh you made far coin 2 so now you just added far coin 2 to some doge game that's got like a million users every day so you don't see the problem with that that someone can just stick a far coin 2 on a game with a million users without the permission of the developer it's a huge problem it's a huge problem if you go and play a game and you're earning fart coin too because some random person want distribution for their shit coin and they did nothing to get it right and you're going what's going to happen is you're going to have games with with a million users that have 500 shit coins attached to them and people have wallets full of garbage right so yeah so there's a very simple reason we talked through all the game theory on this so you just gotta think these things through like there there's no there's no way to support it like it would be garbage if we did that okay so for example let's say um the who like how how does that get implemented like who decides and how do they do it very simple um it and this was all laid out and damon was in the conversations i think ian was too you were like just just explain it though yeah it's very simple it's it's whatever game you came if you're coming in from a wallet so a context where you're coming into a specific a link that's specific to a token so say you're in ledger and you're you're looking at doge and you tap play on the doge then what's already being passed is a parameter for the doge coin now that means when we show you these games you're only earning doge coin the user never even knew that there were other tokens attached to these games oh you're not losing anything it's baked in it's by default okay what i mean is it depends on where you came from so if there is a doge game where you can earn shiba in doge you if you tap on that game and by the way one of the other reasons this came up is because we were thinking a lot about stable coins and even the bitcoin games so so this issue comes up everywhere we we thought through it like so imagine you have bitcoin games. When we launch, we're only on Solana for a minute, right? So it's not going to have native Bitcoin. It's going to have SoBTC, which is a wrapped Bitcoin on Solana.",

Okay, if you come from our site where you're not clicking on a specific type of coin you can get it all if you go directly to the game's website because they have it hosted on markstein.com you can get it all right um which by the way like also may cause problems so does it create a situation where the rewards are unbalanced for that game for people who have an entry point that gets them everything? Does it unbalance anything long-term? No, because each reward pool is a totally separate pool of rewards. That's the other thing that's important about this. So it doesn't create any imbalance.

You definitely don't want to do it as an approval. If you do it as an approval, basically a lot of stuff is going to... People are never going to come back to our interface. They don't have any push notes. They're going to never know. We send them an email. No one sees it. Basically, you'll have a bunch of failed connections. It would have to be something where you could could shut them off after they've been connected it would not make sense to make it something where it's like you have to wait for someone to grant it yeah so if i'm in a wallet attribution right that whole thing is those those only and i hit play and open in browser what happens if you're in a wallet yeah if i decide to just get the link and go so if i take the link to the game and go direct i'm outside the wallet i'll get all the rewards right like if i go find the way we talked about it as currently designed i don't know how it's currently implemented i mean you know we're playing telephone with kai i have no idea yeah i don't so my other question and then we can stop and you guys can take over my my last question just to understand how this works because these questions are going to come up with devs in the situation where it is the wallet so for example just use doge like doge is in uh you know whatever like whatever wallet and you hit you hit the button how is it controlled do we do we automatically say oh this is in a wallet we block all token except the one the link that they're clicking is do we control that by default yeah the api should control that yes okay there's a we already have like uh we already have authentication that gets passed through the wallet api that we haven't really like i said it's not fully implemented on any wallets because kai never finished it um so there's not a single wallet that has an end-to-end implementation implementation so if we're talking about what exists, it doesn't exist completely. If we're talking about what we've – the way that it works is you can pass authentication in when someone taps the play button, which every wallet can choose how they do that. And then they can also pass in which token that the user is looking for games for. So we already have this information. So there's not any new parameters that are required to do this. We just we just simply take oh they came in through the doge link and we're going to show them doge games and they're",

Well, interestingly, dev doesn't have to do anything for any of this. So, actually, I think with Web2 devs, you – so this is a mistake Scott made on the call. I was on the call with him with a game dev yesterday. It's like, I don't think – like, so I onboarded 90-ish percent of these devs, and I asked every single one of them if they use crypto and it's probably 85 plus haven't so they are going to have no clue what you're talking about you try to explain any of this to them anyway so basically they're getting token rewards and that's about the extent they're going to understand this yeah it's it's just right yeah they're not going to get any of this so it's all going to be lost on them right until they actually use it and start to figure it out yeah i just wanted to complete the loop of me understanding the basics in case it did come up so i don't have to worry about this later because we're actually doing this right now so you understand why i'm asking this i i know we have the meetings about it but it's like it's different when we're building it like all these questions still come up so okay yeah everybody has to get up to speed on everything yeah's yeah so yeah so i do know kai's been crushing he's at a point damien can give an update on it um it's uh yeah we're we're just down to the ui part we're helping with it but uh i'll shut up now and i'll have more questions later cool thanks no i think it's great that you're like digging in the implementation details of everything so it's another round of mental QA on everything, and I don't know how it was actually implemented, so it's good to keep revisiting it because things get lost.",

I mean, we do attribution now, so it's a moot point. Well, it might not be a moot point if this part is not clear. So, like, this is another thing you should clarify with kind of. So, yeah, I mean, like, if ignoring attribution, like, you're only able to earn points for something that is associated with the game at the time you're playing so if if some other random token shows up in the 23rd hour of the day and it gets added to this thing you haven't earned any points against that right yeah i i yeah not until you play in that last hour exactly not until you play that last hour and that should have been the way it's always been designed so i don't know how the attribution",

Turns out we can't do staking on the bonding curve. Therefore, we can't do voting. And then I was like, well, wait a second. We can still do voting on the bonding curve. So, like, we don't need to do staking on the bonding curve. We can still do voting we can still do fee distribution on the bonding curve and then i don't remember where we left it because i think after that like isn't in the state now where people are we're still waiting for for graduation to give anyone fees that's the current paradigm right this is actually different than every other successful launcher right now so every other launcher is doing what i suggested which is you start sharing fees from the moment you're on the bonding curve so if you look at boop and you look at pump now is sharing fees um you look at believe which is you know nikita's thing like everybody is sharing fees from the moment the bonding curve launches nobody is waiting for graduation because most of the tokens don't graduate. So if you wait for graduation, you create a ton of inefficiency because you're basically waiting for something that doesn't come for most tokens, like 99% of tokens or whatever. And then you're just kind of storing those fees for really no reason when you could be rewarding the players and the devs from the moment the token launches. So I think it's like 100% clear that we should be doing that. I think the only reason we ever got stuck on this was two reasons. One was we created these other milestones around graduation that we now remove. None of those other milestones around players or games are there. And the second reason was, hey, we're using Meteor's staking rewards feature. rewards feature so like it's kind of easier for us if like we just do everything through that and that doesn't work on the bonding curve but that doesn't stop us from that's a technical detail that has nothing to do with the design details which are like it's actually simplest for the user if you just say everybody's getting fees all the time right it's it's a simpler design than saying everybody has to wait for graduation to get fees, which introduces complexity, doesn't reduce it.",

Right. Check with Breeze, I'm fairly certain we have it where we could pull the fees out before graduation if for some reason we had needed to so that kind of core piece should be in the smart contract and then i'm just parsing through distribution so that goes back to the allowing the voting um with obviously in the bonding curve phase i added task around it that we just that we had never gotten to it yet but I'm",

I thought that what we were using was Meteora's staking rewards for the graduated phase. But I know that Greece tried to do that, so you're saying we didn't end up doing that. Correct, we didn't end up doing it. we have staking and we've've been testing. We're actually working on wrapping kind of the vertical stack of it that the contract's done. So we have staking as a thing, but it's not Meteor-dependent. I see. So this is related to this conversation, is that we have a call with Meteor earlier today. and you know how they flagged for us that their damm b2 was ready um like i don't know a month ago or something and then like we asked spreece to look at it and basically it was like hey i don't you know this seems like it might be time consuming and let's ignore it because we're trying to finish the contracts um and then they also released their dbc their dynamic bonding curve which is like their bonding curve instead of the one that we we wrote from scratch and um this meteor is behind believe so i don't know if you guys have been paying attention to this on the timeline but they are also the main token launching um api that's being used for this this app which is now having its its moment it's not a not a friend tech moment yet it's not a pump that fun moment yet but it is it is growing um quite well and uh yeah they they're using damn v2 and they're using the dvc and they wanted to like basically have a call with us today to explain all these learnings from the launches that are happening i believe um and and to like help us out and like make sure that we understand the differences between using the old stuff that we're on versus the new stuff and um i have been talking to meow and basically he said like their engineers are working 24 7 to support the believe team on these launches because it's going well and i think like you know they're going to support us either way But what they've signaled to us is like hey guys like if you're on our old code from three months ago and and then like shit starts hitting the fan like we're not going to be in the same position to go like help you as much like a lot of these problems are solved in our new stuff and um there was like a like as you know it's not it's not like an incremental upgrade like it's like a rewrite dmv2 so um my my thinking is like we have to hear the final sort of um list of differences from them and then make a call or whether or not we're gonna migrate before before we go live knowing that like if we're on the stuff, we're not really going to be getting much support.",

Yeah, you'd think that it'd be possible. It's just locking the tokens and giving rewards. Basically, we're our own AMM, and we have our token pair. I don't see what prevents us from putting some aside some aside for that for that staking the same way is for a liquidity pool i guess the extra work would be like managing is it on bonding curve",

It would be nice if people could, because then it's the same UFs through the whole thing, right? People can stake and earn, like, rewards the entire time. There's no real distinction between graduated and ungraduated. And it's easier for people to to just get it understand it and then we could carry the staking through like when it graduated we could just assume if you were staked on the bonnet curve you want to remain staked didn't we damon this is a conversation we had like i'm having deja vu like like a month ago about if that was even possible like when this had been graduated, like if we could maintain their staking position.",

So that's good validation. Okay. What else are we going to cover? Sorry. Let's talk about Airirdrop if you want. So coming back to this, one thing that I remembered after we finished and I was almost going to bed is that back in April we discussed that the most efficient thing and simpler thing for us to do for the gems airdrop was to limit it to the Solana chain because it implies that we need to know ahead of time how much is going to be get claimed on each chain and we won't know that until until we know with how many people are you know until we get all the points and do that snapshot and blah, blah, blah. So we, sorry, my throat. So that means that we either have the chance to reverse that decision, because if we're going to do this for every other, you know, open game protocol user, do we not do that for them?",

And as you're adding your wallets, that should not be a dollar sign. It starts to tell you that these are how many points you have for your claim. If, well, let's just assume that we're going to do multiple chains because it's the same either way. Since we're going to do multiple chains, users land. Like in this case, a person has a Solano wallet, they don't have any holdings there, but then they add their base wallet, and all of a sudden they have, oh, you have these many points.

In which case case we still let people track all their wallets, but then we tell them specifically claimants all on it, period. And then they just... Okay, so, and then if they forget to add a wallet, then they can, like, add a wallet after... Yep. Because there still could be tokens on all sorts of random chains that they're like oh shit I forgot my Binance Smart Chain wallet I mean in theory we would set like hey you know after a year this you know the airdrop closes or after six months but yeah during that period or forever if we wish somebody can come back and you know find remember they had this weird you know this odd wallet in in ethereum that they forgot about and it turns out that it has a bunch of game points yeah so what's your plan on this this um airdrop of like g game point token holdings um is this just once over the the first two weeks or is there like an ongoing campaign i believe we want to make them ongoing but the system we're setting up is is just for this one but i believe we want to do more than one um that's the that's what i remember from the last time i spoke about this with kai okay yeah i don't think we can just do it once um it seems like like blur you should plan for multiple seasons of this and if the first one is is just until the tge um which could be anywhere from a couple weeks to a month or whatever after we we go out you'd want the second one to be significantly longer yes um yeah you don't want it to be one month it should be like",

That's a much different status than people said no. People said yes, and then we're like, okay, I ghosted you. And then we're like, hey, these guys are in. So it's not a helpful way of reporting on their status. What should I tell Alicia? What should you tell Alicia? That there are a couple others. She didn't ask for the list. Yeah, I don't have to name them. She said how many others, right? Let me look at the wording. Yeah, just how many others. So just tell her there's a couple others. It's a small, small curated crowd. Small ecosystem. And like there's others who are interested but aren't going to make launch. So she doesn't think she's alone. Yes, that might not be. From her perspective, the fewer, the better. She's just going to get more. She's less commoditized. Her stuff looks better because we're not pitching like five of these things. And she's just in a tweet right she she probably wants stuff that's just like rosebud is the best and that's basically the situation she's going to be in so yeah there's just a couple others um there's more that are that are like in the process of integrating but they're not going to make launch so so and then for the amount of coins i'm going to say like you know over 100 that's simple and then how many coins or what is the question about coins, I'm going to say, like, you know, over 100. That's simple. And then for the – How many coins – or what is the question about coins? The question is, are there – no. How can we work together? How many games? How many games will OGPU be launching with? Yeah, how many games? Yeah, it's over 100 i think it's fine okay um and then the mark",

      "text": "and then the final one was do they want well there's a question about meme coins too you said right does she want to tell them yeah i'm gonna tell her like yeah so i'm gonna say you know we have trump we have doze we're really focused on giga chad however what exactly was the question are there new meme coins you would like us to create oh just well we don't want her to create meme coins no games we want create games for me coins right yeah yeah sure okay yeah good idea yeah yeah i'll tell and then i was i was thinking like you know i was going to tell her you know just the nature of the platform it really could be anything but i'm just going to tell her giga chat because that would be really helpful so okay that's all i just didn't know if you wanted numbers but we can be vague and just tell her a few or the platforms that's all i just have a thing about numbers i don't know we should expose that's all and then oh damon uh the call with dream core um remember that's the guy that i he was like didn't want to it's not that he doesn't want this is a cool guy from japan that chased justin down on stage with his phone and he has really funny games the thing is is they're part of his platform so there's two ways there's like two and he's not an engineer so there's two ways of looking at this there's one is getting him to integrate the platform like we do with like rosebud and you know exo but i i don't think there's time for that right now but i did kind of talk him into because i walked through he's i'm like hey can you go in there and download code download code? He's like, oh, yeah, I can. I'm like, cool, so we can maybe do standalone games. Then I explained it will promote his platform. Long story short, that's where he's like, can I get an engineer on a phone with an interpreter? So I'm trying to organize a time. If you saw the thing, he just responded like, I don't know, a half hour ago. I gave him a window based on like what you might be available. It's kind of six to ten your time um i like do you have time tomorrow if not i'm still going to take the call with him to just explain like or just ask him if they can still do that like i have to talk him into downloading html games from their platform and putting them to standalone so it's like when you go to their game now their platform it's a platform they have a carousel tiktok scroll but if you get them independently and we and they just put them up they can still promote their platform so it's like a shitload of traffic for them that's what i'm selling them on traffic traffic traffic what happens when you just embed the url that they're embedding in their iphone because the games already live on a separate page inside their their platform so can you just inspect the element and just see where the url is and then just put add that yeah i think i tested it we could so if that goes but i'm talking about integration that would just be for the daily rewards if they're not integrated i want them integrated i see so so like um what did he say on that i didn't so it's a he's yeah so he's remember he's not an engineer so he's always like i have to talk to the engineers this is beyond me like i was trying to talk to him about html just download it host it and it was like kind of outside his knowledge so he suggested to get a translator and we'll have a call i was like great so at least we got him to like consider this and then the call would be to the engineer just be like hey and then we can explain to him all of the ways to integrate maybe they're like really good at like doing this i don't know but that's where i need help like engineering wise so it's like either integrate your whole platform or if not integrate a standalone game and then we'll figure your platform out out later. Sorry, my attention hasn't been there. Just send me the URL that we're talking about, and... Check your DM. It's in there. I DM'd you before. I know today's... I think we just need to suggest to all these guys a pretty particular standard integration. I think when we leave it open-ended, we just end up with a lot of who are like confused and um most of them don't have the motivation to figure it out so it doesn't get prioritized that's my sense um and and so like when we like like rosebud tried to figure out everything they're like whoa you have like these docs that are really confusing and stuff that doesn't work but we're trying to figure it out just kept asking us all these questions but everybody else was just like um i don't know this is great i want to do it but It doesn't seem ready, so I'm just going to figure it out. We just kept asking us all these questions. But everybody else was just like, I don't know.",

But, like, we have docs, and it's kind of, like, maybe possible, but no one knows how to do it. The Parasel type of thing? Or just a regular game? No, these are AI game creators. So the implementation that they want is someone makes a game on their site um and then they can just enable open game protocol rewards so they can handle that but then there's a question of like do they use their own login kai put support for um other jwt token logins right but but no one's ever implemented that so so like the other things kai has done like we have not a single fucking reference on on any like can you show me a page where somebody else put a login in and like this works does it exist right and that's where i try to say like hey guys go implement this and it doesn't literally doesn't even exist so yeah i mean we need we need like a reference for all these guys because they're a category so they're going to do roughly the same implementation which is people create the game they hit a radio button that says i want to add uh open game protocol token rewards then they see the multi-token selector that that carlos already built where can search and select the tokens, and then they add it and they use our dev registration API endpoint to do it. Now that part seems pretty straightforward, but we should just provide a doc where we literally show that so they're not having to figure out this stuff somehow by themselves. And then the other question is when people play the games on their site how do the rewards get saved it's",

We definitely made it where you can pass any – even without your own authentication, you can pass your own custom player ID, and we'll save under that player ID once, you know, if they're using our automated UI, great. Once they go to Claim, they'll log in with Privy, and we match whatever custom player ID. Okay, we pair those together. We know that's who it it was um and uh and then they and then yeah they get their points saved correctly so that that's that's part's all in there so i can tell you the part that i'm worried about is not that part of that part because the widget kind of handles most of that the part i'm worried about is the reward management and claiming so like how how does that happen with third-party logins right now if you're a rosebud and you never want to send people to open game protocol i understand that their login saved the points and the the rewards but i've never seen an implementation of somebody else making a dashboard where you can go claim those things and my assumption is it's pretty hard because we didn't build a widget for that right as far as i know that's correct yeah so this is like incomplete that is the reason that we're stuck with all these people is we don't have a single implementation to share with people so like there needs to be docs that are like are you an ai game by coding platform here's what you do game creation add a radio button to add open game protocol to the game um add the multi-token selector to let people pick which tokens it's for that part's straightforward okay now you don't want to have open game protocol login be the thing that people collect on because that's really annoying they're already signed into your service this part that stuff like already seems to exist um and then the final part is like how are the tokens claimed and managed if they want to have that on their profile page with the user's own wallet like we have on our site which is probably what they want like we need to make it easy for them to do that like if they have to rewrite that entire page in the wallet management stuff that's probably not going to be easy enough for people to implement and so there needs to be a specific we have like instructions on how to integrate with a game but we do not have instructions for how someone with a bi-coding site which there's like five that said they want to do it, but there's like 20 that would if we had a thing.

We're actively working on that so we can ship with the next release. I'll keep you updated. Again, in the meantime, you can work with it on a development version of Ledger Live.

Yeah, Ian, you're now in charge of all wallets. So the sales, the sales have happened. Even like, even Ariel went and actually made like spec implementation specs and suggestions for every one of these. He made docs where he photoshopped play buttons in and showed how it would look in every wallet. He went and opened and used every single wallet to do that. That was back before he was busy with all the marketing stuff he's on now. And so, like, there's a lot that's already been done. What's not done is there's not something working. So it needs to be project managed. When there are, it needs to have appropriate docs, a working slice, like you said, Damon, so that we can actually push them to implement something that works. And then needs to be project managed that's and and right now like Scott is responsible for which makes no sense he's just like the conversation opener and he's on a million fucking calls like he cannot and he's not technical he cannot manage it so it makes a ton of sense for Ian to be on this sure how many wallets are we talking to and who else is i'm gonna add you to all the chats okay rip well we look we we have the you know we divide here like we we have the people we need to do the things we're trying to do.

They already have a login on their site to keep track of the points people earn in the games where it's relevant. But all this other stuff is kind of irrelevant. The only reason we're confused is because we don't have a reference implementation and design where we're just telling them what to do and if he had a reference implementation like like what ariel did when he mocked up the 40 wallets we talked to then then he would pretty much understand what we're doing too right it's not a translation issue it's just like a just no no that was very specific topic but yes you Yes, you're right.

You draw, like, I'm not telling you to actually build his real UI. I'm telling you to mock up where the button would go so he just understands the logical flow. You show a radial button that says, like, add open game protocol rewards. He says, I don't like the way that looks. He says, that's fine. Make it look however want this just shows you how it worked um and then and then you put the token selector there when they turn the radio button yes i want open game protocol rewards yeah carlos creates but like as if i'm a user i go in there create a game yeah yeah and then then it it calls this api call add game with the tokens that the the person attached with Carlos' widget, which already exists. So this stuff literally already exists. And then from there, there's a separate implementation for letting people earn the rewards with their own login, which supposedly already exists, but if the documentation isn't good enough, then it needs to be improved. and um and then the final part that we know doesn't quite um exist as much as it should have is around like if the profile has some integrated wallet where like people can view all their stuff easily their points and their claims and manage all that that that does not exist so okay so i can i can i'll mess around with figma do a mock for this and then gaming let's go over with you and we'll just figure out like where this lands with all the parts yeah oh i can really be able to cool yeah i think it's two-thirds built so like yeah the good news is it news is it's not, the game creation stuff is definitely fine, and at a minimum, their games would be created and playable wherever we publish them if they only did that part, and they didn't do the other parts of letting people earn rewards on their site, we would still be okay. I mean, they would have to inject the, sorry, the one thing that I glossed over is they'd have to inject the code for the scores into the game, which Rosebud figured out by themselves pretty quickly, but that's something that's not on us. That's not part of the API. It's like they need to figure out how to instruct their agent to inject the API code and register the score at the right time. So, yeah, we just need to come up with an integration guide. The Dream Lab guy got back to me in like five minutes, by the way. I'm on a chat with him right now. Oh, yeah, because you're going to type into it forever, and you never want to do it. No, I just DM'd him. So he said, hey, how are things? Over the last month, we've grown a bit and massively improved our server-to-planning system, excited for the OGP launch, and we be replying to low-pass very soon. So, I guess he's good enough.",

And I tried it six times. Six. And I got four errors. We'll pull in kind of the morning. I'll make sure the three of us meet up and we just go over that issue. Yeah, that'd be great if I can get in there. Yeah, just let him know. Just point it out to him. Just let me know. That's all. I put the console on there, too. Cool. Okay. Can I go? Your turn, Justin. Yes. Okay. Okay yes okay um yeah look so just one more thing about um an idea that i had and i wanted to get your guys take on it about how we launch so i know that um we've got obviously like all of us launched from around uh trump game point and everyone's like well this is you know obviously like if you're going out with one of these protocols you need to go out with a bang that's how you kick off everything else to work um however um there's also an option i think for us to to basically launch without even announcing",

      "text": "like it would let us test the full um cycle it would be a great way to reduce risk man we can graduate and stop on people get the money back well we we cannot just to be clear our our policy is going to be that we can't inside trade these tokens like no one in the company should company should be trading these tokens. So I realize, and that's clear, like, we have to do that. Now, I realize I can't police that. So, like, if, you know, Scott has some side wallet that he's trading these on, that's his own prerogative. But the moment that it, like, anybody flags it in the public, I have to fire him instantly. So that's the risk anybody's taking if they go and do that um but look i um we yeah so we're not trading them so the point is like anyway but we can we can arrange for people to to like we can just share it with our investors for instance and say hey we're in alpha we're not telling anyone today um but we launched with this random coin and we've got like a couple games on it and we we just wanted to get up to you know like graduation or whatever to test the whole thing and then we're gonna um launch the real thing like or you know the community of trump will launch the real thing when when everything looks good when you i'm not saying i'm going to do this but i think we need to be clear in some kind of post and all or some kind of weekly meeting about the trading thing. Because when you said it's really – Yeah, there's a policy. I mean, we've said it before, before we launched previous – No, you say it just like you said it to us right now, that one-liner. I can't say that in a document. I can't tell you that you're going to do what you do on the side but you'll get fired i'm just telling you that we can't police anybody but if if there was anything of course we can't monitor people's entire life right so so what i'm saying is pragmatically um it is the company policy that you cannot trade these game coins that is the company policy for every company that has any sort of new asset class it's not meeting us it's it's every single one of these nft companies that takes them seriously in the last five years or or crypto company has the same policy oh i know i've signed it's the same and then some people might do it anyway but that but if they do it they're definitely getting fired the moment like anything came out it would be it's our policy this, and yeah, that person broke the rules and that they're out. It wouldn't even be a question. Right, and that goes for OG token too, or main token, anything. No, no, protocol token is you own it. Of course you're going to have some of it. I'm talking about the other assets. The problem is, and the OpenSea case was the big thing, where it is that we are going to have ways to influence the UI of the app that change what trades. So, if you change the way that the top tokens are sorted and you own some random game coin, but, like, now the algorithm benefits that game coin, then that's, you can manipulate the price of that, right? So, that's the problem. um we say we have this page the top five tokens are showing right now, and then we change it from market cap to some other thing where it's like market cap divided by this plus this or whatever. We're going to know how that's going to change the sorting. And so if you own a token where it's suddenly going to be on the top of the page that wasn't on top of the page before, it's like you... Yeah, that's just one example, but there's 100 reasons. That's interesting. interesting never thought of it like that that that's what happened with open c so what happened with open c is people were buying nfts or some guy or maybe more like we're buying nfts before they featured them on the home page so like he he could pick them up before they got a bunch of exposure right and we have all these marketing plans like you know when um or you may be aware of when certain um posts will come from certain people about certain projects and certain games will be being integrated that you think are going to be huge like you're just going to be in a position where you know things that other people don't know so we cannot that's why we can't be creating them so i know a lot of people are are bullish on them i think what we might be able to we might be able to do if people want to get exposure to them is I've been talking to Lore, which there's a couple platforms like this. But basically, they have, like, ways of trading baskets of coins. And if someone just wants to get, like, indirect exposure via some other thing, like Lore has this thing where some other person manages, like like a basket of game coins or an asset and then you can buy into that thing and it's almost like an etf and it's like they're managing it but you're not managing it that might be like fine because you're not betting on any particular thing in a way where you have any way of knowing how something is going but but i think the index way of getting exposure to game coins is just to own the og token anyway so it doesn't allow you to be degenerate and make make 100x but um when can you buy more og um but just regular like hey i want to buy this well let's wait until kai gets the official policy on that that that i don't there's's nothing the the thing about og is like um so anyway the way it usually works with stock in like public companies you have to file for your sales kind of in advance um i don't think a lot of crypto companies are doing that i so i don't it's like a 10b5 it's called so like i i used to for example to sell zinka stock because i was a key holder like you had to just file it ahead of time so like you say i'm going to sell every month like this much and you can't change it and then like people know that you're not trading on inside information because your sales are are like predetermined um of course you need exit liquidity but like you you you're not trading based on any information because you've registered your trades for the year ahead of the timing.",

I mean, the shit coins and the trade, it's going to suck, man. Seriously, looking at the charts, like GigaChat, if one game is like Tiger goes off and promotes a game and it goes crazy, it's going to be be like oh man i really want this i think people every time it happens you're making money with with og that's right yeah and you're not getting the the same level of like multiple exposure but you're getting the you're getting the risk adjusted basket which is kind of better because like you don't you don't want the downside of all those right and the only way you could trade those and actually make clear the 10Xs is if you're trading 24-7 and you'll never be able to do your job. Yeah. No job, no token. So, yeah, no job, no token. That is always an option. You know, you could always just retire at some point and just trade game coins. Yeah, right. Then you're in the clear. You know, that is – you could just opt out and be like shit man this is an opportunity of a lifetime i gotta go yeah fuck you guys i'm out no no yeah so og is like basically it's like s&p 500 you put money in you just never touch it you just leave it just goes up that's it so that's why i asked so kyle be able to tell us know like when time comes yeah yeah yeah we have to have an official policy on it so yeah 40 Lambos okay I think we have the other media I'm done by the way I don't have any more questions yeah me too but reactions on that idea of the launch I'm all for it I like it because I'm all for it's like quote unquote testing and prod and there's really no and this gives us the opportunity to bring like you said bring in people because they're just they're gonna find everything we didn't but we want them to specifically we've learned from d3 whatever went wrong we've learned from virtuals whatever went wrong we've learned from boop whatever went wrong we don't know what can go wrong here so this gives us the op it's qa that's what it is they're gonna yeah my sense is like in terms of what goes wrong with the community and whatever plays out in prod that's like more of um the stuff that like boop is changing things and they're getting you know shit for this and things for that that stuff we're not going to be able to fix any of that from doing this for two to three days this is like more just like a pure technical um prod qa pass which i think is helpful but but we won't you know we're still going to have like this won't tell us for example like how people are going to game the system because there won't be enough users using the system we're not going to tell anybody about it this is more like it yeah this is like it all works in prod and it seemed like nothing went wrong and we all got like some rewards and whatever that's what this is yeah and polish i like it i think it's a great idea now how does this work it went i mean someone's gonna see it someone's gonna link it people are gonna come here and they're gonna have an opinion they're gonna think it's our launch how do you handle that yeah so we i just wanted to.

  "full_text": "wallet situation we're not going to show or display trump so all those people get screwed so what happens is like long term the way damon was explaining it you have an advantage to play it's going to be in doubt the rewards are going to be in balance so you're getting screwed as a player that just wants to play in our coins in the doge game in the doge wall because you're not getting trump so when i heard this i like freaked out because i'm either not understanding this why are we blocking people from earning tokens that defeats the whole purpose of the protocol the only thing i can think of can you say it again oh yeah so the way that i heard it because now like i'm trying to understand this because we're doing the whole points thing now and this came up when we were trying to design what we needed to give to kai this morning so when you're in a doge game in the doge wallet right you see all these doge games doge game one two three four and i go play them there's a situation where one of those games might actually be tagged with two other tokens however you will not be getting the points for those tokens in the doge game because we're blacklisting blocking whatever word you want to use yeah we covered this in this fall like weeks ago no no do you know the reason for it i know what you're talking about yeah i decided this and we covered it weeks ago so you were in the conversation maybe you didn't get what we were talking about no no we we don't get it so can you explain how it started or why we're doing it yeah it's very simple so like there's a there's a traffic like attribution issue so if you think about it like any game can have any token attached to it right and actually people can attach other tokens to a game after the fact so there's nothing stopping you from taking any random doge game and just adding your shit coin to it like oh you made far coin 2 so now you just added far coin 2 to some doge game that's got like a million users every day so you don't see the problem with that that someone can just stick a far coin 2 on a game with a million users without the permission of the developer it's a huge problem it's a huge problem if you go and play a game and you're earning fart coin too because some random person want distribution for their shit coin and they did nothing to get it right and you're going what's going to happen is you're going to have games with with a million users that have 500 shit coins attached to them and people have wallets full of garbage right so yeah so there's a very simple reason we talked through all the game theory on this so you just gotta think these things through like there there's no there's no way to support it like it would be garbage if we did that okay so for example let's say um the who like how how does that get implemented like who decides and how do they do it very simple um it and this was all laid out and damon was in the conversations i think ian was too you were like just just explain it though yeah it's very simple it's it's whatever game you came if you're coming in from a wallet so a context where you're coming into a specific a link that's specific to a token so say you're in ledger and you're you're looking at doge and you tap play on the doge then what's already being passed is a parameter for the doge coin now that means when we show you these games you're only earning doge coin the user never even knew that there were other tokens attached to these games oh you're not losing anything it's baked in it's by default okay what i mean is it depends on where you came from so if there is a doge game where you can earn shiba in doge you if you tap on that game and by the way one of the other reasons this came up is because we were thinking a lot about stable coins and even the bitcoin games so so this issue comes up everywhere we we thought through it like so imagine you have bitcoin games. When we launch, we're only on Solana for a minute, right? So it's not going to have native Bitcoin. It's going to have SoBTC, which is a wrapped Bitcoin on Solana. now if you the distribution of so BTC it's like a totally different company in a lot of cases like that one of our investors is the guy who invented wrapped BTC in a theory wayu the founder of kyber invented wrapped btc it was not invented by the bitcoin foundation oh that's been so so so my point is like it doesn't say say we make a game about fiat u.s dollars and and you want to tag all of the stable coins on it which makes sense like uncle sam's you know dollar grant usdc usdt etc it doesn't make sense that some random like you know shitty usd coin that's a 500 down the list now gets all the distribution into players wallets that the usdc coin grow because usdc is everywhere right so you go to play usdc game and you earn usdc but what if you're also earning usdt and then you're also earning usd you know ian and usd daemon and usd mark and like no one even knows what those are now suddenly you're just giving all this free token distribution to these tokens that no one even cares about so yeah we went through all this like no i know i know you keep saying that i get it i'm just i i understand you're like what the hell who made this decision this is dumb and like you just didn't get it i didn't say it was no no no yeah i didn't get it because like we're going through the particulars on the side here and there's like we're trying to figure out how to because there's going to be uneven point distribution so well if you because if you play those games and they're tagged and they're not able to get them however you can do that it's not shown to you so like no you don't get them there's a difference you actually don't get them not showing you don't get them and they're not shown to So, like, the user doesn't know that they're not getting a thing because they're not even shown it. They don't even know it exists. Right, so what we were talking about, which I didn't – I'm just trying to understand this because it's all related to what we just – it's already built. Like, I built it, all right? So what we were trying to figure out is, like, what Gaiman brought up, which I didn't understand. That's all. I was just trying to wrap my head around it. So that same game, right, that goes – the one that you don't get the tokens in because you're playing from a wallet, you can go on our site and play the game and you will get the tokens. Does that create... It has to do with the entry point. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. So if you come from a USDC play button, then you should just earn USDC for the game. Okay, if you come from our site where you're not clicking on a specific type of coin you can get it all if you go directly to the game's website because they have it hosted on markstein.com you can get it all right um which by the way like also may cause problems so does it create a situation where the rewards are unbalanced for that game for people who have an entry point that gets them everything? Does it unbalance anything long-term? No, because each reward pool is a totally separate pool of rewards. That's the other thing that's important about this. So it doesn't create any imbalance. Like USDC's reward pool is totally different than USDT and USDMark and USDIN. They're all like GUSDIN may be a small market cap token with $100,000 market cap with barely any rewards. And USDC might be this massive $5 billion. GUSDC might be a massive $5 billion game point. Like the reward pools are completely unrelated. So there's no imbalance. The points are particular to a token that you're earning. And each token has, and the votes are different too, right? Like, maybe Uncle Sam's Dollar Grab is the number one game on USDC. Like, everyone voted for it. But for some reason, like, on GUSDE, and, like, no one voted for it. And it's, like, doesn't have a lot of the rewards. They're all independent. So there's no like transferability between these points they're just totally separate tokens now i mean if because anyone can just attach random crap to any game you may end up in a situation where if a game has like a lot of users it's we still have a problem here where the problem we haven't solved is like how do you prevent a bunch of random shit coins from attaching themselves to games that have traffic when people go directly we may have solved the problem from an attribution standpoint which is necessary but there may be a second step necessary which is like a developer can just right exactly which is a separate thing yeah so we this is like when we're before we got off the call i remember last night damon i said i was just gonna go like i was gonna go tag everything with three tokens i was gonna bought it like that's actually possible that's what i would do right yeah so it's like basically the games that are wide open from an attribution standpoint where you gain everything could pose a problem but the games from the attribution standpoint that are in a wallet that are focused on just that token it's like play now play get play this doge game we're we're fine it's the other situation okay right which in the beginning like it may be that like we're not even really going out with any of these wallets integrated because we haven't done anything to support them yet so right so that's where we may be in a situation where yeah the default is actually that a lot of games will just have a bunch of tokens that people are earning because they're going directly to game links or something right so yeah that's yeah so it may be a problem that we have to solve now so in the case of one is developer control which is you let developers pick which tokens they actually allow on their game yeah this happens. You definitely don't want to do it as an approval. If you do it as an approval, basically a lot of stuff is going to... People are never going to come back to our interface. They don't have any push notes. They're going to never know. We send them an email. No one sees it. Basically, you'll have a bunch of failed connections. It would have to be something where you could could shut them off after they've been connected it would not make sense to make it something where it's like you have to wait for someone to grant it yeah so if i'm in a wallet attribution right that whole thing is those those only and i hit play and open in browser what happens if you're in a wallet yeah if i decide to just get the link and go so if i take the link to the game and go direct i'm outside the wallet i'll get all the rewards right like if i go find the way we talked about it as currently designed i don't know how it's currently implemented i mean you know we're playing telephone with kai i have no idea yeah i don't so my other question and then we can stop and you guys can take over my my last question just to understand how this works because these questions are going to come up with devs in the situation where it is the wallet so for example just use doge like doge is in uh you know whatever like whatever wallet and you hit you hit the button how is it controlled do we do we automatically say oh this is in a wallet we block all token except the one the link that they're clicking is do we control that by default yeah the api should control that yes okay there's a we already have like uh we already have authentication that gets passed through the wallet api that we haven't really like i said it's not fully implemented on any wallets because kai never finished it um so there's not a single wallet that has an end-to-end implementation implementation so if we're talking about what exists, it doesn't exist completely. If we're talking about what we've – the way that it works is you can pass authentication in when someone taps the play button, which every wallet can choose how they do that. And then they can also pass in which token that the user is looking for games for. So we already have this information. So there's not any new parameters that are required to do this. We just we just simply take oh they came in through the doge link and we're going to show them doge games and they're going to earn doge and this user doesn't care about doge in and doge mark and doge daemon it just one they just want doge yeah it's only allowing them doge that relative point right okay through the API okay yeah so the user doesn't even care or know about those other points no this has nothing to do with the user this is me explaining to a dev like if when it when it comes up that's All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All don't know what they're missing. This has nothing to do with the user. This is me explaining to a dev, like, when it comes up, that's all. Okay. Well, interestingly, dev doesn't have to do anything for any of this. So, actually, I think with Web2 devs, you – so this is a mistake Scott made on the call. I was on the call with him with a game dev yesterday. It's like, I don't think – like, so I onboarded 90-ish percent of these devs, and I asked every single one of them if they use crypto and it's probably 85 plus haven't so they are going to have no clue what you're talking about you try to explain any of this to them anyway so basically they're getting token rewards and that's about the extent they're going to understand this yeah it's it's just right yeah they're not going to get any of this so it's all going to be lost on them right until they actually use it and start to figure it out yeah i just wanted to complete the loop of me understanding the basics in case it did come up so i don't have to worry about this later because we're actually doing this right now so you understand why i'm asking this i i know we have the meetings about it but it's like it's different when we're building it like all these questions still come up so okay yeah everybody has to get up to speed on everything yeah's yeah so yeah so i do know kai's been crushing he's at a point damien can give an update on it um it's uh yeah we're we're just down to the ui part we're helping with it but uh i'll shut up now and i'll have more questions later cool thanks no i think it's great that you're like digging in the implementation details of everything so it's another round of mental QA on everything, and I don't know how it was actually implemented, so it's good to keep revisiting it because things get lost. Yeah, and I'm just trying to learn some of the pieces that I don't understand now I do, so thanks for explaining. yeah i mean my situation last night is like i need kai to work on this in his morning he's not around my late night at all so as as clear as I can. I put this dock together, laid out all these connecting pieces, because I know that we have this attribution and context up there. Basically, if you have the entry point for doge only then you know you're only scoring points on doge but then if you went to you know directly to the developer's game or whatever you know you're kind of in this global context then you're earning for all games but at that point your points are a little different so i need to make sure that you know we account for that Let's do this. you're earning for all games but at that point your points are a little different so i need to make sure that you know we account for that right these points balances are different for every token they always had to be different for every token anyway because so it was if the devs had built it in a way where they weren't already different it was already wrong and off spec because because any token can be added at any time so even if doge even if there was um there was never a single point balance that that was never a thing that was an incorrect implementation like if doge was there and then w doge got added midday and i played the game in the morning and then w doge got added midday my points from the other doge wouldn't have carried over anyway there was never like a per per game points balance Thank you. midday, my points from the other doge wouldn't have carried over anyway. There was never, like, a per game points balance. In, well, actually, in that sense, I there is, in a way, you have your general points, but I guess, yeah, there's attribution, but when we... No, there's never, Damon, because, like, you don't, every day, you're just earning these points, and Thank you. you have your general points but I guess there's attribution No, there's never, Damon because you don't every day you're just earning these points and they're just adding to a points balance and if someone can add a token to a game at any moment you can play the game in the morning and earn some points on whatever batch tokens were there and then you can play the game in the afternoon after somebody added three more tokens and now you're also earning points against these three other tokens but clearly you weren't earning points against the tokens that weren't Thank you. were there and then you could play the game in the afternoon after somebody added three more tokens and now you're also earning points against these three other tokens but like clearly you weren't earning points against the tokens that weren't there in the morning even if we ignore attribution sure yeah i mean that uh that makes sense uh Yeah, I guess it depends on the allocation mechanism. I mean, we do attribution now, so it's a moot point. Well, it might not be a moot point if this part is not clear. So, like, this is another thing you should clarify with kind of. So, yeah, I mean, like, if ignoring attribution, like, you're only able to earn points for something that is associated with the game at the time you're playing so if if some other random token shows up in the 23rd hour of the day and it gets added to this thing you haven't earned any points against that right yeah i i yeah not until you play in that last hour exactly not until you play that last hour and that should have been the way it's always been designed so i don't know how the attribution stuff was designed but but like you should make sure that that's also the case and there's not something weird going on where i can just carry a bunch of irrelevant points to some token that gets added at a point where i didn't play it yeah i need to double check that detail I'll see you next time. point where i didn't play it yeah i need to double check that detail because that would open up a lot of um they got a ton of problems like but but people would just be able to like pray arbitrary rewards on a game by um if a bunch of people like, a million people are playing this game, there's all these things, they just turn on rewards an hour before, and then, like, everybody who gets, who already had big points in that could steal reward costs. So imagine, like, imagine that there's a token I want to get a lot of, and I already have a very high score in some game, me and my cabal of guild, or whatever we're doing, and we're already farming this game, and then Thank you very much. a lot of and i already have a very high score in some game me and my cabal of guild or whatever you what if we're doing and we're already farming this game and then we at the 23rd hour after we farm the game all day we send a bunch of votes um for this token that we is now highly valued to just take all the points that we earned when it wasn't even attached to this token suddenly we we like dominate you know the um reward pool for some other random token when we weren't even playing against that token it's like a sneak attack in the final minute so even though the coins are independent the pool is global for whatever tokens attached so they're going to detract from the guys in the first 24 hours on that last hour right um the yeah the pool the pool for the particular token yeah yeah exactly so like but they have to have the votes so and the players but you know because 20 of the rewards is determined by traffic so say there's some big game that's already out there and the rest is determined by votes and they can just create a lot of weird situations where someone's like they they weren even playing against this thing and the last final minute they stake a bunch of votes and then they unstake it three minutes later. They stake it and then they unstake it three minutes later and they're just stealing a bunch of rewards from some random token. by the way um related to this so we've we've this is one thing that we've had a lot of conversations about and like i'm even confused on where we we last ended up but i know i know where i want to be, you know, in the very, very beginning of, like, all this, we were like, hey, you know, the bonding curve fees are 1%. Turns out we can't do staking on the bonding curve. Therefore, we can't do voting. And then I was like, well, wait a second. We can still do voting on the bonding curve. So, like, we don't need to do staking on the bonding curve. We can still do voting we can still do fee distribution on the bonding curve and then i don't remember where we left it because i think after that like isn't in the state now where people are we're still waiting for for graduation to give anyone fees that's the current paradigm right this is actually different than every other successful launcher right now so every other launcher is doing what i suggested which is you start sharing fees from the moment you're on the bonding curve so if you look at boop and you look at pump now is sharing fees um you look at believe which is you know nikita's thing like everybody is sharing fees from the moment the bonding curve launches nobody is waiting for graduation because most of the tokens don't graduate. So if you wait for graduation, you create a ton of inefficiency because you're basically waiting for something that doesn't come for most tokens, like 99% of tokens or whatever. And then you're just kind of storing those fees for really no reason when you could be rewarding the players and the devs from the moment the token launches. So I think it's like 100% clear that we should be doing that. I think the only reason we ever got stuck on this was two reasons. One was we created these other milestones around graduation that we now remove. None of those other milestones around players or games are there. And the second reason was, hey, we're using Meteor's staking rewards feature. rewards feature so like it's kind of easier for us if like we just do everything through that and that doesn't work on the bonding curve but that doesn't stop us from that's a technical detail that has nothing to do with the design details which are like it's actually simplest for the user if you just say everybody's getting fees all the time right it's it's a simpler design than saying everybody has to wait for graduation to get fees, which introduces complexity, doesn't reduce it. So, yeah, it's better for users, better for devs, it's easier to understand, and it's more in line with market in the top three launch paths. So, I don't see any reason not to be doing it. All right. I can't argue with that i think it makes sense i think our current design is we're just saving up these rewards and then um adding them to the reward pool the moment that the token graduates yeah so damon yeah the change here would be that our bombing curve is taking these fees and distributing them daily based on a similar algorithm to what we do with these when the token has graduated question justin do like like trading fees rewards fine but like the locked liquidity that's put out at graduation we we should not be distributing that before graduation right no i'm not suggesting that i'm just suggesting just double check that's all i've ever suggested yeah yeah so so look the the um yeah i'm not suggesting that i'm suggesting fees so we're taking one percent fees in the bonding curve right now we're just putting these in a basket that will never be used by 99 of tokens which is a completely wasteful um so i'm suggesting that we immediately put those back to use as um player and game rewards what this means in practice is that there will be a game a game coin economy for every single thing that launches the moment that it launches even if it has a hundred dollars in volume there will now be a dollar of rewards available for players and devs so like this is and then for the users there's no distinction or difference between graduated and ungraduated they all have the exact same functionality they all reward people um yeah graduated tokens have a deeper reward pool so they're able to provide more rewards but they don't really need to care about those details like the rewards are there if a token exists there's rewards it's easier to understand so damon i i think that like a lot of our current logic is relying on this this very specific meteora staking rewards stuff so so i i don't i mean i'm i don't know how major Thank you. is relying on this very specific Meteora staking rewards stuff. So I don't know how major of a change this is, but we're already taking fees on the bonding curve, and the question is how to move toward a reward structure that allows for voting without staking at that stage. Right. Check with Breeze, I'm fairly certain we have it where we could pull the fees out before graduation if for some reason we had needed to so that kind of core piece should be in the smart contract and then i'm just parsing through distribution so that goes back to the allowing the voting um with obviously in the bonding curve phase i added task around it that we just that we had never gotten to it yet but I'm trying to remember because I remember off the top of my head like that mechanism of how they have votes let's see if I can find it. I might not have it or I'm not seeing it so I guess so I'm trying to think by the way we're not using the Meteora bonding curve it wasn available to us. And then the kind of staking we needed was a little simpler anyway. So the rewards for it come through our Oracle, just like everything else. So I'm trying to think, is it a thing to stake in the bonding curve phase? Oh, no, no, you don't need to stake in the bonding curve phase. Sorry, we're mixing up a couple things here. I thought that what we were using was Meteora's staking rewards for the graduated phase. But I know that Greece tried to do that, so you're saying we didn't end up doing that. Correct, we didn't end up doing it. we have staking and we've've been testing. We're actually working on wrapping kind of the vertical stack of it that the contract's done. So we have staking as a thing, but it's not Meteor-dependent. I see. So this is related to this conversation, is that we have a call with Meteor earlier today. and you know how they flagged for us that their damm b2 was ready um like i don't know a month ago or something and then like we asked spreece to look at it and basically it was like hey i don't you know this seems like it might be time consuming and let's ignore it because we're trying to finish the contracts um and then they also released their dbc their dynamic bonding curve which is like their bonding curve instead of the one that we we wrote from scratch and um this meteor is behind believe so i don't know if you guys have been paying attention to this on the timeline but they are also the main token launching um api that's being used for this this app which is now having its its moment it's not a not a friend tech moment yet it's not a pump that fun moment yet but it is it is growing um quite well and uh yeah they they're using damn v2 and they're using the dvc and they wanted to like basically have a call with us today to explain all these learnings from the launches that are happening i believe um and and to like help us out and like make sure that we understand the differences between using the old stuff that we're on versus the new stuff and um i have been talking to meow and basically he said like their engineers are working 24 7 to support the believe team on these launches because it's going well and i think like you know they're going to support us either way But what they've signaled to us is like hey guys like if you're on our old code from three months ago and and then like shit starts hitting the fan like we're not going to be in the same position to go like help you as much like a lot of these problems are solved in our new stuff and um there was like a like as you know it's not it's not like an incremental upgrade like it's like a rewrite dmv2 so um my my thinking is like we have to hear the final sort of um list of differences from them and then make a call or whether or not we're gonna migrate before before we go live knowing that like if we're on the stuff, we're not really going to be getting much support. Got it. Back to the previous part, though. So, okay, we have a 1% fee. We can distribute them. I just want to be clear on the that allocation mechanism we need to be able to have votes and i i just i i remind me how we said we were going to do the votes yeah so just both based on your token holdings but instead of having them, you just simply have to go based on the number of bonding curve tokens you hold. And then for the fees, there are no staking rewards. So basically in this phase, you don't need to reserve 40% of the fees for stakers. so i don't know damon or ian do you have an opinion on like player to uh player to dev ratio because it doesn't seem like we would reserve anything for stakers um if we don't reserve anything for stakers i mean we've let me see like that would be well is it possible to do staking on the bonding curve in the past you said it wasn't damon but like is that is there anything change there well depends on this upcoming meeting but that's what i was thinking it was that if we're doing our own custom staking i think there could be a way where we allow that. Yeah, you'd think that it'd be possible. It's just locking the tokens and giving rewards. Basically, we're our own AMM, and we have our token pair. I don't see what prevents us from putting some aside some aside for that for that staking the same way is for a liquidity pool i guess the extra work would be like managing is it on bonding curve versus liquidity pool i don't know if that's extra work but you know let's breeze about this because that would kind of be interesting so it sounds like it's probably possible which would be ideal I don't know. Because that would kind of be interesting. So it sounds like it's probably possible. Which would be ideal. It would be nice if people could, because then it's the same UFs through the whole thing, right? People can stake and earn, like, rewards the entire time. There's no real distinction between graduated and ungraduated. And it's easier for people to to just get it understand it and then we could carry the staking through like when it graduated we could just assume if you were staked on the bonnet curve you want to remain staked didn't we damon this is a conversation we had like i'm having deja vu like like a month ago about if that was even possible like when this had been graduated, like if we could maintain their staking position. We've talked for sure about having about how can we use these fees and have voting. At that time, pretty sure we're like, okay, we're definitely going to be using the Meteora staking and that would prevent us from Thank you. At that time, pretty sure we were like, okay, we're definitely going to be using the Meteora staking, and that would prevent us from having staking with the vote flow happen. So, okay, how do we do votes? And then, yeah, you reminded me, it would be based on the number of tokens you hold. So that was a previous conversation we had. So the reason we wouldn't be able to stake before launch was because we were using Meteor's thing and we wouldn't be able to do that on behalf of the user. But if it's custom-written by us, then maybe we can. Yes. Because otherwise it's dependent on liquidity pool and all that. So, yeah, I kind of want to all honest briefs right now. so one of the things that their damn v2 does is that you um you receive these in the quote token uh which should be helpful for us right sorry what was that with the quote token He's saying the b2 dams let you pick which token you get all the fees and i just chuckled because of the conversation i had with breeze this morning was it about this topic of like swapping tokens or something yeah like we went through like okay let's make sure that that the that the diagram with where the fees flow is accurate precisely Thank you. of like swapping tokens or something yeah like we went through like okay let's make sure that that the diagram with where the fees flow is accurate precisely because of that and we okay made sure that it's the right arrow was pointing towards the right place in the right percentage and that's that's it well also right now it's the the other token has to be swapped into the the vote token in a lot of situations to pay for the I don't what was the way what was the implication there I guess is my point is it helpful to have the fees and the vote token I think that's how Ian originally designed it and then it was like oh you oh, you know, we get both, and then I think Ian adjusted for that, so I think, I assume he's going to use that. It's certainly easier if we choose one token, yes. okay yeah that's definitely possible with dmv2 as well i don't have a sense and i don't know that breeze even ever costed it in our conversations of of how long it would take to migrate but i know that it would require like another complete audit so i'm well aware that if we do it it's like 20 seconds not in the cards that's my my assumption that would be very true it's it it's dicey at the moment already well justin didn't you say last night that that would you know even you said one month uh no no no i never made an estimate of a cost what i what i said is uh so no i that's not i did i did say i did give these numbers but it was not a cost it was it was assessing like the expected like risk adjusted you know ignoring the actual real implementation costs costs um just like how long do i think it would take based on the black box world of of the details that are known now ignoring the fact that we haven't actually costed it so i know that an audit takes like a week okay so like i know that if if bruce rewrote it in 30 minutes we have a week of an audit on what's largely a new smart contract so that's that's knowable um and then i know that there's some changes after the audit and that's going to take a few days so so assuming it takes briefs like you know anything under a week then you're at a minimum like two and a half weeks already and this is what i meant and then assuming that's something kind of like nothing goes wrong it's kind of and then so i was saying hey and then And if you add some risk on it, then it could be three or four weeks. None of this is meant to be an estimate it might be that breeze looks at it now he actually knows how to be a solana dev and like you know he there's a lot of stuff he's figured out right like basically it did not take 12 weeks to write the solana contract it took 12 weeks for breeze to figure out how to be a solana engineer that's my my my take and now i think he's like kind of a salon event engineer um and so like he can actually look at this and you know it might not be crazy i don't know i remember ultimately looked at it he seemed to like and thought it wouldn't be too too bad no this isn't the um this isn't uh vertigo which he was positive about oh right right yeah that was vertigo never mind yeah the vertigo he didn't really give much of an assessment of damn v2 he was just kind of like i'm busy rewriting this thing just seems like i can't even look at it i think that was where we Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. of an assessment of damn v2 he was just kind of like i'm busy rewriting this thing this seems like i can't even look at it i think that was where we got to yeah yeah you're right vertigo has distribution issues so like they made a new type of amm it sounds really attractive they have no proof that it works there's like one single token launched on it and then it's not integrated in most things so it has distribution issues like a big part of being a good dex launcher is you you do the bd to be involved in everybody's random thing and compatible with everything and that's just takes time so they're in phantom wallet somehow but they're not in like deck screener yet or like anything else so you know if we along with them the reason i i didn't feel like okay let's go for it it's one meteor has been very helpful like half of our marketing credit goes to meteor like the guy that they hooked us up with has been putting us in touch with everybody um and you know we could rug them on the social side it wouldn't be nice but we'd make some real enemies um and and um but but the um vertigo is unproven and a lot of it is actually marketing marketing language i talked to ben from meteor about it who's not technically a meteor anymore obviously and he was just like this is nice but like none of this exists so this guy's telling you like all this stuff is sniper proof and everything else but he hasn't launched a single goddamn token he's just like i've got the battle scars to tell you this is all bullshit like yeah okay cool he figured out like one or two things to prevent sniping but but he hasn't used it in real world so so like you know whatever he's just his opinion is like this is like a guy who designed a ufo on a piece of paper and then said it works and then everyone's just going to believe him until it doesn't fly that's kind of how the space works yeah i think the meteor team is just like in the literal trenches every day and there's like barely anybody like radium and the meteor team are the only teams that have have battle scars right now so i'm assuming the conversation you have with breeze later with meteor you guys will decide whether or not you're going to want to do v2 yeah yeah we'll decide um they're going to continue to support us socially and even technically either way it's just like we won't be there's now they have a runner of an app with believe and so believe is driving the product roadmap and the guys every day they're literally making it better the v2 every day based on this real stuff that's happening and we're going to be on a divergent branch they're not going to want to improve because it's old and they're deprecating it and meanwhile like believe is going to be driving new features on the roadmap every day and we could be too so it'll just be a like a really bad situation to i think yeah yeah it's belief thing is crazy and i'm assuming that like nikita has a lot to do with this like i can't discern real from fake i'm trying to figure it out it's meme coins they're they're mean they say on their site that you have no um they say when you go to launch a coin for like your company they say it cannot be a security you cannot give any equity you cannot give any um opportunity you can't give anything that would be um considered to be sharing profits or doing anything that would give people any expectation of profit in the future it is a meme coin launcher wherever you attach your company name to it and then on the marketing in the app store they say become a billionaire by investing in the next big thing it's really it's really sketchy to be honest with you like i every i'm all for like you know no crying in the casino as some people say but i have a real problem with believe because because the marketing for the app in the app store says you're going to get rich by being like an investor you can become a billionaire because you invested in some app but then when you go to launch a coin it literally tells you like these are not investments you're just launching straight up meme coins and like anybody who buys it it's merch they use the word merch and then on the on the app store marketing it's using like the exact opposite language so they're it's pretty fucking sketchy like it's fine like what people like about it the takeaways like the positive things about it are that is quite similar to our model which is that the the devs of the coins usually don't hold any of it and they're making money on the fees from the trading and a lot of the traders like that because they feel that they can't be rugged because the dev isn't holding a bunch of the coins and they will dump it on them when they get successful they're just making money from the trading volume so the the web2 it's actually a story quite similar what we're building which is the web2 company builders these gen zers who are launching companies on it um they don't they're not actually launching a token um other people are launching the token with with the tweet and so they have no sec issues and it's a meme coin so there's no there's no legal issues for them and they're only making money from the bees so because they're only making money from the fees um they're they're not like subject to any And of like insider trading because most of them shouldn't or aren't trading their own token they're just making money on the fees from other people trading this thing that they've said is worthless merch so it's all like legally um quite quite good but it's sketchy in the way that they're they're marketing it to the trader suggesting that it's attached to any real value it's just mean coins attached to the company so but what i what i think is good about it and what it validates for us is that actually a lot of people like this this model where like you're not relying on this dev not dumping on you because because the fees are what is benefiting the people who are creating the thing so that that is the same as our model. So that's good validation. Okay. What else are we going to cover? Sorry. Let's talk about Airirdrop if you want. So coming back to this, one thing that I remembered after we finished and I was almost going to bed is that back in April we discussed that the most efficient thing and simpler thing for us to do for the gems airdrop was to limit it to the Solana chain because it implies that we need to know ahead of time how much is going to be get claimed on each chain and we won't know that until until we know with how many people are you know until we get all the points and do that snapshot and blah, blah, blah. So we, sorry, my throat. So that means that we either have the chance to reverse that decision, because if we're going to do this for every other, you know, open game protocol user, do we not do that for them? Or we should, you know, stick to keeping things as simple as possible and limiting it to one. But regardless, I mocked up both passes and both begin in the same place because those options don't matter until the airdrop. So we talked about, okay, we're not gonna talk about linking your wallet. It's literally just add wallet and it doesn't get saved anywhere other than like tracking this. And as you're adding your wallets, that should not be a dollar sign. It starts to tell you that these are how many points you have for your claim. If, well, let's just assume that we're going to do multiple chains because it's the same either way. Since we're going to do multiple chains, users land. Like in this case, a person has a Solano wallet, they don't have any holdings there, but then they add their base wallet, and all of a sudden they have, oh, you have these many points. And at that point, we tell them, okay, select your blockchain, and depending on which one they pick, then we send them to the relative, you know, for, like, these are both the same mockups, but the meaning is one is for the Ethereum airdrop, the other one is for the Solana chain airdrop, and the base has to be a third one, if we wish, which is all doable, particularly because creating each one of these pages is just telling the telling the team, hey, we have yet another one, here are all these tokens in blockchain, here's a list of who is eligible for them. And that's it. However, like I said, there are complications around allowing anybody to claim on any chain like the first one being how do we know how much to put in each chain or do we just put so much in each chain that we want to that basically we guarantee we're never gonna run out and also how many chains are we going to to um support for this airdrop is it just ethereum based on solana are we going wider is it just ethereum and solana um that's the man that's the big question um these pages like i i I put this, but I didn't mock up how this changes, but here is where we would add those terms of service that Kai has given them for our liability, and then they would also have to click on theirs. But this is how the typical token table page looks, and like I think we have some control over some of the copy and over some of the branding, but that's it. Every claim page is cookie cutter template, and there's very limited branding available. So it sounds like you think we should just have everybody claim on Solana. I do. Okay, yeah, I mean, to make the call. Yeah. Great. Then that's what we do. In which case case we still let people track all their wallets, but then we tell them specifically claimants all on it, period. And then they just... Okay, so, and then if they forget to add a wallet, then they can, like, add a wallet after... Yep. Because there still could be tokens on all sorts of random chains that they're like oh shit I forgot my Binance Smart Chain wallet I mean in theory we would set like hey you know after a year this you know the airdrop closes or after six months but yeah during that period or forever if we wish somebody can come back and you know find remember they had this weird you know this odd wallet in in ethereum that they forgot about and it turns out that it has a bunch of game points yeah so what's your plan on this this um airdrop of like g game point token holdings um is this just once over the the first two weeks or is there like an ongoing campaign i believe we want to make them ongoing but the system we're setting up is is just for this one but i believe we want to do more than one um that's the that's what i remember from the last time i spoke about this with kai okay yeah i don't think we can just do it once um it seems like like blur you should plan for multiple seasons of this and if the first one is is just until the tge um which could be anywhere from a couple weeks to a month or whatever after we we go out you'd want the second one to be significantly longer yes um yeah you don't want it to be one month it should be like six months like a second season but i wouldn't really change you could add more incentives and there's nothing stopping us from adding random incentives that give you points later like pretty much change it mid-flight if we want to um that seems like a lot of projects have done that that's fine but I would keep the main incentive as holding game points yep alright well then, that's the decision. I've spent a fair bit of time working on copy. I don't feel that it's quite there yet. I've shopped it around with Marketing, with mark and damon and with uh architect waiting to get everybody's feedback but i'm happy to show you what i've got okay i think it's great to get people's feedback but i think great copy never comes from her so which is why i was like really pushing for you to just deliver it because in my experience It in my experience, like, basically, it's like that Johnny Ive talk that happened last week, where he, I don't know if you saw the interview he did with the Collison brothers for the Stripes thing, but basically, he said, like, the problem, I'm paraphrasing here, but he's like, the problem in design is that, like, everybody has an opinion. um and and it's it's great it's great to get feedback but it's it's terrible to land on the five exact words that you need to put on a page because um the group will just never like you don't want the mid-curve take you want like a strong thing that kind of like when people see it like the average person just likes it but but if you ask for everybody to craft, you're going to get confusion. So, that's my take on this. This is what I've gone with. First one is, I really like that tagline, game coins make any token play to earn. And trying to determine, like, how is it different from other assets? It's like they sit on top of real top of real well i put hype coins but it can be real coins like dozer trump and turn them into play to earn asset um and then it's it's like meme coins i don't say meme coins but they're inherently built for speculation except they are driven by real activity um okay i don't i yeah um i'll just i'll i'll just take this over don't worry about it okay i'm gonna i'm gonna it's just i it's a really really tough one to get right and like i don't know i less is more here like these are too long like like i think every bullet has to be about five six words and um yeah anyway we're just wasting time now so i'll take it all right oh and that's it for me i have some stuff you could take. Don't worry about it. Focus on the games. I got it. No, that's kidding. I have a question, though. If Ian's done? Yeah. So this is just very simple. I'm pulling it out. So I responded to... Damon, I... I posted the update about we're doing internal migration. The feature will be live. I'm talking about tagging, so I took care of that. I don't know if you saw Scott's thing. I don't know why he's double tagging because I was already on this. It's kind of annoying. But Leisha has some questions, and I don't know what information to give her. So basically simple how her questions are um how many other creation platforms is ogp launching with how can we work together on some promo material for creating games so it's like you know i could like scott but how many games are ogp be launching with but like and there are are there are there new meme coins you would like us to create us or so i can answer these questions but like do you do i want to say like who the other creator platforms are Thank you. are there are there new meme coins you would like us to create us so i can answer these questions but like do you do i want to say like who the other creator platforms are because like it's really them and like that's really it we have the other guys dream core guy remember marky that guy that you were like this guy's the best he's super excited about integrating like what do you that guy yeah yeah so we'll here did you did you read all that or no i can give you the update on it so this week he gave me an update saying it was basically like oh you know they're busy because they're trying to launch beta and all that so i had a call i did you see that i was like hey you know this is a really good idea to promote your platform long story short i can you're talking about dream core yeah dream lab dream lab is the guy that you know the phone with yeah yeah not dream lab that chat i'm looking at that chat there's nothing no no yeah i'm not talking about dream core dream core never said he was in dream lab said he was in two months ago and that wrote a bunch of code what's the status of that yeah yeah so that's what i'm like why i've been updating i don't know where he is i give him all the updates i just they're not the same thing so dream lab is the one that you said the guy was totally in and then you wrote a bunch of code and then i don't see any updates now but like he did a weird jd dance thing i don't know why he went on a side quest but like did he implement did he implement the thing or i don't think so have you dm'd him directly uh directly no i've just been like in the channel trying to get his attention yeah just reach out to him directly get in touch with the guy we have his email to you like this so because the answer like yeah i mean it's not correct to say that like only only they are in like there's there's multiple people who said they were in for lunch and then we have not followed up with those people that is the state of those things who else have we have not followed BitMagic said they were in, and then we have not followed up with those people. That is the state of those things. Who else have I not followed up with? BitMagic said they were in. And then we have not followed up with BitMagic. No, we haven't. We determined that they weren't going to be ready for lunch. That's a much different status than people said no. People said yes, and then we're like, okay, I ghosted you. And then we're like, hey, these guys are in. So it's not a helpful way of reporting on their status. What should I tell Alicia? What should you tell Alicia? That there are a couple others. She didn't ask for the list. Yeah, I don't have to name them. She said how many others, right? Let me look at the wording. Yeah, just how many others. So just tell her there's a couple others. It's a small, small curated crowd. Small ecosystem. And like there's others who are interested but aren't going to make launch. So she doesn't think she's alone. Yes, that might not be. From her perspective, the fewer, the better. She's just going to get more. She's less commoditized. Her stuff looks better because we're not pitching like five of these things. And she's just in a tweet right she she probably wants stuff that's just like rosebud is the best and that's basically the situation she's going to be in so yeah there's just a couple others um there's more that are that are like in the process of integrating but they're not going to make launch so so and then for the amount of coins i'm going to say like you know over 100 that's simple and then how many coins or what is the question about coins, I'm going to say, like, you know, over 100. That's simple. And then for the – How many coins – or what is the question about coins? The question is, are there – no. How can we work together? How many games? How many games will OGPU be launching with? Yeah, how many games? Yeah, it's over 100 i think it's fine okay um and then the mark and then the final one was do they want well there's a question about meme coins too you said right does she want to tell them yeah i'm gonna tell her like yeah so i'm gonna say you know we have trump we have doze we're really focused on giga chad however what exactly was the question are there new meme coins you would like us to create oh just well we don't want her to create meme coins no games we want create games for me coins right yeah yeah sure okay yeah good idea yeah yeah i'll tell and then i was i was thinking like you know i was going to tell her you know just the nature of the platform it really could be anything but i'm just going to tell her giga chat because that would be really helpful so okay that's all i just didn't know if you wanted numbers but we can be vague and just tell her a few or the platforms that's all i just have a thing about numbers i don't know we should expose that's all and then oh damon uh the call with dream core um remember that's the guy that i he was like didn't want to it's not that he doesn't want this is a cool guy from japan that chased justin down on stage with his phone and he has really funny games the thing is is they're part of his platform so there's two ways there's like two and he's not an engineer so there's two ways of looking at this there's one is getting him to integrate the platform like we do with like rosebud and you know exo but i i don't think there's time for that right now but i did kind of talk him into because i walked through he's i'm like hey can you go in there and download code download code? He's like, oh, yeah, I can. I'm like, cool, so we can maybe do standalone games. Then I explained it will promote his platform. Long story short, that's where he's like, can I get an engineer on a phone with an interpreter? So I'm trying to organize a time. If you saw the thing, he just responded like, I don't know, a half hour ago. I gave him a window based on like what you might be available. It's kind of six to ten your time um i like do you have time tomorrow if not i'm still going to take the call with him to just explain like or just ask him if they can still do that like i have to talk him into downloading html games from their platform and putting them to standalone so it's like when you go to their game now their platform it's a platform they have a carousel tiktok scroll but if you get them independently and we and they just put them up they can still promote their platform so it's like a shitload of traffic for them that's what i'm selling them on traffic traffic traffic what happens when you just embed the url that they're embedding in their iphone because the games already live on a separate page inside their their platform so can you just inspect the element and just see where the url is and then just put add that yeah i think i tested it we could so if that goes but i'm talking about integration that would just be for the daily rewards if they're not integrated i want them integrated i see so so like um what did he say on that i didn't so it's a he's yeah so he's remember he's not an engineer so he's always like i have to talk to the engineers this is beyond me like i was trying to talk to him about html just download it host it and it was like kind of outside his knowledge so he suggested to get a translator and we'll have a call i was like great so at least we got him to like consider this and then the call would be to the engineer just be like hey and then we can explain to him all of the ways to integrate maybe they're like really good at like doing this i don't know but that's where i need help like engineering wise so it's like either integrate your whole platform or if not integrate a standalone game and then we'll figure your platform out out later. Sorry, my attention hasn't been there. Just send me the URL that we're talking about, and... Check your DM. It's in there. I DM'd you before. I know today's... I think we just need to suggest to all these guys a pretty particular standard integration. I think when we leave it open-ended, we just end up with a lot of who are like confused and um most of them don't have the motivation to figure it out so it doesn't get prioritized that's my sense um and and so like when we like like rosebud tried to figure out everything they're like whoa you have like these docs that are really confusing and stuff that doesn't work but we're trying to figure it out just kept asking us all these questions but everybody else was just like um i don't know this is great i want to do it but It doesn't seem ready, so I'm just going to figure it out. We just kept asking us all these questions. But everybody else was just like, I don't know. This is great. I want to do it. But it doesn't seem ready. So I'm just going to ignore it until you tell me it's ready and it's actually ready. And so my sense is, like, for these guys, like, we just have to go in and say, hey, like, add a button that says turn on open game protocol rewards for this game when someone's creating a game. And they can radio button and turn that on. And then after that, select the tokens that this game is relevant to. And that's it. And then, like, they should figure out if they want to do reward claiming off-site, then, you know, people have to go to our site to claim stuff. And if they don't, they don't. But we don't have, like, an example implementation here, Damon, which is a real problem. That is actually the thing that these things are blocked on. Like, basically, we have, like, four or five companies that all said they want to do this. But, like, we have docs, and it's kind of, like, maybe possible, but no one knows how to do it. The Parasel type of thing? Or just a regular game? No, these are AI game creators. So the implementation that they want is someone makes a game on their site um and then they can just enable open game protocol rewards so they can handle that but then there's a question of like do they use their own login kai put support for um other jwt token logins right but but no one's ever implemented that so so like the other things kai has done like we have not a single fucking reference on on any like can you show me a page where somebody else put a login in and like this works does it exist right and that's where i try to say like hey guys go implement this and it doesn't literally doesn't even exist so yeah i mean we need we need like a reference for all these guys because they're a category so they're going to do roughly the same implementation which is people create the game they hit a radio button that says i want to add uh open game protocol token rewards then they see the multi-token selector that that carlos already built where can search and select the tokens, and then they add it and they use our dev registration API endpoint to do it. Now that part seems pretty straightforward, but we should just provide a doc where we literally show that so they're not having to figure out this stuff somehow by themselves. And then the other question is when people play the games on their site how do the rewards get saved it's pretty shitty if if someone's playing in these random sites where they already have a login and they have to like go to our site that's stupid um so that's why we built the third party login thing but then the third party login and rewards claiming is not a single person has implemented it so basically like these functions maybe exist but but there's no no one has any idea how to actually do it is that yeah good assessment damon All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All know that we definitely – that exists. I'd have to follow up to see if they're using it. We definitely made it where you can pass any – even without your own authentication, you can pass your own custom player ID, and we'll save under that player ID once, you know, if they're using our automated UI, great. Once they go to Claim, they'll log in with Privy, and we match whatever custom player ID. Okay, we pair those together. We know that's who it it was um and uh and then they and then yeah they get their points saved correctly so that that's that's part's all in there so i can tell you the part that i'm worried about is not that part of that part because the widget kind of handles most of that the part i'm worried about is the reward management and claiming so like how how does that happen with third-party logins right now if you're a rosebud and you never want to send people to open game protocol i understand that their login saved the points and the the rewards but i've never seen an implementation of somebody else making a dashboard where you can go claim those things and my assumption is it's pretty hard because we didn't build a widget for that right as far as i know that's correct yeah so this is like incomplete that is the reason that we're stuck with all these people is we don't have a single implementation to share with people so like there needs to be docs that are like are you an ai game by coding platform here's what you do game creation add a radio button to add open game protocol to the game um add the multi-token selector to let people pick which tokens it's for that part's straightforward okay now you don't want to have open game protocol login be the thing that people collect on because that's really annoying they're already signed into your service this part that stuff like already seems to exist um and then the final part is like how are the tokens claimed and managed if they want to have that on their profile page with the user's own wallet like we have on our site which is probably what they want like we need to make it easy for them to do that like if they have to rewrite that entire page in the wallet management stuff that's probably not going to be easy enough for people to implement and so there needs to be a specific we have like instructions on how to integrate with a game but we do not have instructions for how someone with a bi-coding site which there's like five that said they want to do it, but there's like 20 that would if we had a thing. We can just go easily sell it. So this is a real category. That's why they're stalled. They're stalled for the same reason the wallets are stalled, which is there's incomplete documentation in code for the same reason the wallets are solved which is there's incomplete documentation and code for the implementation yeah the the wallet stuff definitely isn't done i know like the it part of it is like seemingly blocked on being able to test like nobody's able to test finance nobody in our company yeah but he could have just went and done that on any of the other you know dozen wallets yeah so that's that's bullshit that's not no it's not bullshit it's more like finance and ledger where we were blocked on and then i was like well we had ledger're not blocked they got back in the last combo and they're like you can still do it i'm dead there's just something else that were blocked on right the last combo from ledger is he says um hey sorry coming for back to you uh there's some delay the release for the support to off-chain message signing on Solana was postponed as we were having issues with support of the new Solana on Ledger. We're actively working on that so we can ship with the next release. I'll keep you updated. Again, in the meantime, you can work with it on a development version of Ledger Live. This, to me, sounds like somebody who's telling us you're not actually blocked. But I don't know, we feel like we're blocked. Again, in the meantime, you can work with it on a development version of Ledger Live. I don't know. I don't know what that means. I don't know that Kai knows what that means. But I do know that somebody's telling us, like, hey, like, you're not really blocked. So, I don't know. There's, like, a whole DevRel thing here that's just busted. I can't have Scott on wallet relationships. Like, he has no idea. He's not technical, and he has no idea. They consulted all these conversations, and idea they consulted all this conversation so we got everybody excited they did all the outreach and everybody wants to integrate and now we're sitting in these chats i'm clearly not going to own dev rel um i have no idea what the current state of the apis is i is clearly not going to own dev rel we had this conversation three months ago when when he he said as much and he flagged it in the first week so damon i i feel like for wallets it's it's clearly you we said it was going I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don what he's got to deliver. Like, so I don't think that that would even make sense either. So, Damon, I think you own wallet relationships, and Mark owns game relationships. And these Vive coding ones are a weird in-between where they're more complicated implementations than a typical game developer. And we don't have the appropriate documentation and probably full scope of the APIs yet. So that's the state of things. And the reality is like we basically we're at 80% closed with like 25 wallet partners who are just waiting for us to follow up and then these these vibe coding ai coder things are in literally the same place but they're blocked on engineering and dev rel yeah i don't mind pony wallet relations uh at the same time i have beyond negative bandwidth at the moment my myself. And then, like, I need Pi, Santosh, Ruiz as well. Like, we got to get this vertical slice stood up just the core of the app, not outside of wallet you know integration stuff like we we have to have that core thing like i i i don't think it would serve us well to to to to rabbit hole into the into the well here's an idea ian why don't you own wallet relations like i mean you're technical enough to work with people on this and then get to an implementation. Yeah, yeah, I was going to say, like, I can give it a shot. Worst case scenario, at least I know how to get the answer faster than the average pair. Okay, so it is done. Yeah, Ian, you're now in charge of all wallets. So the sales, the sales have happened. Even like, even Ariel went and actually made like spec implementation specs and suggestions for every one of these. He made docs where he photoshopped play buttons in and showed how it would look in every wallet. He went and opened and used every single wallet to do that. That was back before he was busy with all the marketing stuff he's on now. And so, like, there's a lot that's already been done. What's not done is there's not something working. So it needs to be project managed. When there are, it needs to have appropriate docs, a working slice, like you said, Damon, so that we can actually push them to implement something that works. And then needs to be project managed that's and and right now like Scott is responsible for which makes no sense he's just like the conversation opener and he's on a million fucking calls like he cannot and he's not technical he cannot manage it so it makes a ton of sense for Ian to be on this sure how many wallets are we talking to and who else is i'm gonna add you to all the chats okay rip well we look we we have the you know we divide here like we we have the people we need to do the things we're trying to do. We've just... And we used Scott and Diego very effectively as like a sort of sales leads generator. But then we put too much responsibility on them as they're just not in a position to close sales properly. So that's on me. There wasn't a clear handoff here. So they can generate leads but they can't close them uh yeah i'll have i think kyoko is in all of these so I can just have her add you. Okay, cool. We'll get that done today. How about, okay so so on the question of games that's where it gets tricky so mark clearly owns all games uh relations but but then the vibe coder guys are like kind of stuck technically in a similar situation where waltz are so we need like a reference implementation basically so i can give you like the problem So the really tricky thing, you brought it up. I just want to reiterate. I'm just going to put a thing in our chat. Like, this is one of the, we'll call them edge cases. The thing with these platforms is every single question is going to be different. But, like, at the bottom of the funnel, I think it's the same. the demo Flappy Bird that Damien gave I think was really effective and then if we can get one of those this to show hey here's what a platform looks like i mean we can just build a uh html page and a scroller as a demo or something yeah so what he doesn't he so this is i'm looking at the chat message you said yeah i get these all like all kinds of different questions about this yeah so yeah so this is like every everything that we've already outlined is everything that these guys need to do a really great implementation it hasn't been except for the wallet claiming management part which I don't think is good or exists. So when it comes to him being able to submit games that are based on URLs, he probably just didn't see that or is unaware of the API to do that. He's literally saying, he says the URL is determined when chatbot writes and posts the code. After that, there's no support for editing the game. So he can't go back and edit games that have already been created but we don't really care about that um we're saying that when the chatbot goes and creates the game and has the url it should just send it to our ad game api that already exists so like that already that's fine and at that moment it can be um so so there's two questions here do you go back and retrofit old games to be added with ogp i don't think they need to do that i think we're just talking about what gets created in the future and the api already supports that so yeah so that's this is like the thing damien that i was saying like i gave you the to them, like, real quick tomorrow and see, because he's talking from the perspective of, like, I guess it's his platform, but it, I don't know, it kind of sounds like it's not him, but. What do you mean? It is his. I know this guy. I've met him three times, so, yeah, he's, yeah, it's his platform. No, I know, I'm just reading it. It's just, it's translation, English, he doesn't speak, you know, that whole thing. Yeah, it's his platform. No, I know. I'm just reading it. It's translation, English, he doesn't speak, you know, that whole thing. Yeah, it's a little complicated. He can't really speak English. Well, no, the translation does fine. It just gets lost. But I get it. I don't think that there's any confusion about the things you're saying. So he runs a game platform called DreamCorp. It's their platform. They're the company that run it. You can create games on it, but you can also just publish games that you made with some other Vibe coding platform. But none of this makes any difference to our implementation. This is kind of my point. This is all a distraction from the real thing, which is when you submit a game, you push a radio button that says, I want to enable token rewards for this open game protocol. You select the tokens that are relevant to it. The API call gets hit, which registers the game with those tokens. And then people play Thank you. says I want to enable token rewards for this open game protocol. You select the tokens that are relevant to it. The API call gets hit, which registers the game with those tokens. And then people play and you use the session that they already have. They already have a login on their site to keep track of the points people earn in the games where it's relevant. But all this other stuff is kind of irrelevant. The only reason we're confused is because we don't have a reference implementation and design where we're just telling them what to do and if he had a reference implementation like like what ariel did when he mocked up the 40 wallets we talked to then then he would pretty much understand what we're doing too right it's not a translation issue it's just like a just no no that was very specific topic but yes you Yes, you're right. We can't do that right now. So that's what... Yeah, we can. How? Who? Where? Why can't we mock it up? Ariel did it with all the wallets. Like, why can't we mock up what this should look like for his thing? Sure we can. Like, here's our suggested integration. Like, why wouldn't we be able to do that i don't know i'm not being rhetorical like i don't i really don't understand why we wouldn't be able to do that i'm just it's more of a like like a time scheduling game and like where does this fit in and like how how would that get done now i i think that it's like a literally like a i mean mark i've seen you in figma before it's like it's it's like 20 minutes But, yeah, so you open up his app. You go through the create game flow. You draw, like, I'm not telling you to actually build his real UI. I'm telling you to mock up where the button would go so he just understands the logical flow. You show a radial button that says, like, add open game protocol rewards. He says, I don't like the way that looks. He says, that's fine. Make it look however want this just shows you how it worked um and then and then you put the token selector there when they turn the radio button yes i want open game protocol rewards yeah carlos creates but like as if i'm a user i go in there create a game yeah yeah and then then it it calls this api call add game with the tokens that the the person attached with Carlos' widget, which already exists. So this stuff literally already exists. And then from there, there's a separate implementation for letting people earn the rewards with their own login, which supposedly already exists, but if the documentation isn't good enough, then it needs to be improved. and um and then the final part that we know doesn't quite um exist as much as it should have is around like if the profile has some integrated wallet where like people can view all their stuff easily their points and their claims and manage all that that that does not exist so okay so i can i can i'll mess around with figma do a mock for this and then gaming let's go over with you and we'll just figure out like where this lands with all the parts yeah oh i can really be able to cool yeah i think it's two-thirds built so like yeah the good news is it news is it's not, the game creation stuff is definitely fine, and at a minimum, their games would be created and playable wherever we publish them if they only did that part, and they didn't do the other parts of letting people earn rewards on their site, we would still be okay. I mean, they would have to inject the, sorry, the one thing that I glossed over is they'd have to inject the code for the scores into the game, which Rosebud figured out by themselves pretty quickly, but that's something that's not on us. That's not part of the API. It's like they need to figure out how to instruct their agent to inject the API code and register the score at the right time. So, yeah, we just need to come up with an integration guide. The Dream Lab guy got back to me in like five minutes, by the way. I'm on a chat with him right now. Oh, yeah, because you're going to type into it forever, and you never want to do it. No, I just DM'd him. So he said, hey, how are things? Over the last month, we've grown a bit and massively improved our server-to-planning system, excited for the OGP launch, and we be replying to low-pass very soon. So, I guess he's good enough. It just made him want to reply to your stuff. So, I'll just get a call of him. He's cool. Right. Just again, let's get him off the weird JDVance side quest that's not going anywhere. We just want him to implement his platform. I don't care about some random meme game. That's extreme low leverage. Yeah, so the goal here with this is, like, don't Thank you. him to implement his platform i don't care about some random meme game that's yeah so the goal here with with with this is like don't focus on the single games get the platform in this way that's the way we can move forward and everything's fine rather than try to react yeah yeah who cares if these guys put a game in like we want them to put it we want them to integrate their platform yeah we want the platform just go for platform okay damon could i can i what's like the rn chat um so so yes v3 that's that three villain what's v3 we have different v v v as in victor we're talking about the the status of like where we're at with the point system like like literally like by the minute so like where where is it now so i made a suggestion to him i don't know i saw his screenshot my suggestion to him i just kind of stopped him for a minute like he's like let's watch it and i'm like no we got my suggestion was to put this in your flappy bird game i think it's a really good idea this way now we have another we're talking about slightly different things release v3 so it doesn't break anything in v2 and then yeah we can test in the floppy bird game but my point is like don't basically introduce anything potentially broken in our current v2 that everyone's using that's why we need v3 got it okay cool easy decision to me easy decision to me just do v3 we'll pester real quick and then we can let developers use it okay and then so once we get the slappy bird we'll have the docs I'm sure the docs thing will be really short this way I can just refer them to like the anchor and give them the tag and it's done real simple yes okay cool anchor and give them the tag and it's done. Real simple. Yes. Okay, cool. Okay, one more thing that I want to cover and get your opinion on if you guys are done. Yeah, just Damon, what should I do about the situation that I had late last night with registering and the errors? Because I'm able to register on our domains and then there's like Thank you. what should i do about the situation that i had late last night with registering and the errors because i'm able to register on our domains and then there's like the we'll call them the signal domains the real ones to go live i can't register but the other but the same game registered on like you know our like yolo dams and i posted those errors that i've never seen before in our chat Like, should just wait until all this is done and then we could revisit it this is like it's a priority it just i don't mind being blocked like i can i'll just stay up late like if it helps to not address this now i'll just drop it and just wait but i kind of need to know why this registration form is not registering a game. And I tried it six times. Six. And I got four errors. We'll pull in kind of the morning. I'll make sure the three of us meet up and we just go over that issue. Yeah, that'd be great if I can get in there. Yeah, just let him know. Just point it out to him. Just let me know. That's all. I put the console on there, too. Cool. Okay. Can I go? Your turn, Justin. Yes. Okay. Okay yes okay um yeah look so just one more thing about um an idea that i had and i wanted to get your guys take on it about how we launch so i know that um we've got obviously like all of us launched from around uh trump game point and everyone's like well this is you know obviously like if you're going out with one of these protocols you need to go out with a bang that's how you kick off everything else to work um however um there's also an option i think for us to to basically launch without even announcing and and then launch like a small coin um we would still do it via third party but it would be like intended to be like to not make any noise that would basically get us out in production and then We'll be right back. coin um we would still do it via third party but it would be like intended to be like to not make any noise that would basically get us out in production and then um just like using this for a day or two before we we launch trump um the way that that would work would be like damon we've talked about having this these coins that we exclude from being able to be launched we would basically launch the site without telling or announcing to anyone and we would exclude the launch of all coins except for a single coin um that we just made a few games for or even like one game like it doesn't really matter or maybe you know two games so you can test it properly and then that would be like the first coin technically launched in the protocol but like we wouldn't be intending to make any noise whatsoever it's almost like a technical um production uh soft launch alpha thing and so maybe we would send it to some yeah maybe we would send it to like some friends or something and like the intent would not be for the token to send it would be nice if it graduated because like it would let us test the full um cycle it would be a great way to reduce risk man we can graduate and stop on people get the money back well we we cannot just to be clear our our policy is going to be that we can't inside trade these tokens like no one in the company should company should be trading these tokens. So I realize, and that's clear, like, we have to do that. Now, I realize I can't police that. So, like, if, you know, Scott has some side wallet that he's trading these on, that's his own prerogative. But the moment that it, like, anybody flags it in the public, I have to fire him instantly. So that's the risk anybody's taking if they go and do that um but look i um we yeah so we're not trading them so the point is like anyway but we can we can arrange for people to to like we can just share it with our investors for instance and say hey we're in alpha we're not telling anyone today um but we launched with this random coin and we've got like a couple games on it and we we just wanted to get up to you know like graduation or whatever to test the whole thing and then we're gonna um launch the real thing like or you know the community of trump will launch the real thing when when everything looks good when you i'm not saying i'm going to do this but i think we need to be clear in some kind of post and all or some kind of weekly meeting about the trading thing. Because when you said it's really – Yeah, there's a policy. I mean, we've said it before, before we launched previous – No, you say it just like you said it to us right now, that one-liner. I can't say that in a document. I can't tell you that you're going to do what you do on the side but you'll get fired i'm just telling you that we can't police anybody but if if there was anything of course we can't monitor people's entire life right so so what i'm saying is pragmatically um it is the company policy that you cannot trade these game coins that is the company policy for every company that has any sort of new asset class it's not meeting us it's it's every single one of these nft companies that takes them seriously in the last five years or or crypto company has the same policy oh i know i've signed it's the same and then some people might do it anyway but that but if they do it they're definitely getting fired the moment like anything came out it would be it's our policy this, and yeah, that person broke the rules and that they're out. It wouldn't even be a question. Right, and that goes for OG token too, or main token, anything. No, no, protocol token is you own it. Of course you're going to have some of it. I'm talking about the other assets. The problem is, and the OpenSea case was the big thing, where it is that we are going to have ways to influence the UI of the app that change what trades. So, if you change the way that the top tokens are sorted and you own some random game coin, but, like, now the algorithm benefits that game coin, then that's, you can manipulate the price of that, right? So, that's the problem. um we say we have this page the top five tokens are showing right now, and then we change it from market cap to some other thing where it's like market cap divided by this plus this or whatever. We're going to know how that's going to change the sorting. And so if you own a token where it's suddenly going to be on the top of the page that wasn't on top of the page before, it's like you... Yeah, that's just one example, but there's 100 reasons. That's interesting. interesting never thought of it like that that that's what happened with open c so what happened with open c is people were buying nfts or some guy or maybe more like we're buying nfts before they featured them on the home page so like he he could pick them up before they got a bunch of exposure right and we have all these marketing plans like you know when um or you may be aware of when certain um posts will come from certain people about certain projects and certain games will be being integrated that you think are going to be huge like you're just going to be in a position where you know things that other people don't know so we cannot that's why we can't be creating them so i know a lot of people are are bullish on them i think what we might be able to we might be able to do if people want to get exposure to them is I've been talking to Lore, which there's a couple platforms like this. But basically, they have, like, ways of trading baskets of coins. And if someone just wants to get, like, indirect exposure via some other thing, like Lore has this thing where some other person manages, like like a basket of game coins or an asset and then you can buy into that thing and it's almost like an etf and it's like they're managing it but you're not managing it that might be like fine because you're not betting on any particular thing in a way where you have any way of knowing how something is going but but i think the index way of getting exposure to game coins is just to own the og token anyway so it doesn't allow you to be degenerate and make make 100x but um when can you buy more og um but just regular like hey i want to buy this well let's wait until kai gets the official policy on that that that i don't there's's nothing the the thing about og is like um so anyway the way it usually works with stock in like public companies you have to file for your sales kind of in advance um i don't think a lot of crypto companies are doing that i so i don't it's like a 10b5 it's called so like i i used to for example to sell zinka stock because i was a key holder like you had to just file it ahead of time so like you say i'm going to sell every month like this much and you can't change it and then like people know that you're not trading on inside information because your sales are are like predetermined um of course you need exit liquidity but like you you you're not trading based on any information because you've registered your trades for the year ahead of the timing. And so and they go and you can't stop it. That's that's how it usually works with stocks. I don't know. I don't know what the best practice is on the protocol token for or for crypto. I don't see anyone doing public filings like that because it's certainly not required. But I think everything's moving more and more in that direction. Right. As the industry matures. So, I mean, I would just say, like, anybody, it's, if, if there's, if for me, personally, like what I would do, I don't know what our policy will be, we'll just get it from Fenwick. But for me personally, like, I'm going to make sure that however I trade it it there is zero chance that it looks like i timed things in a way that um that looked like i was uh using information that other people didn't have you're buying that probably probably what i would do is set it on some regular interval yeah you're buying later i could be like look there's something happening here where it's just like literally selling on some regular interval. So, like, I have no control over it. That's probably the way I would approach it. But I don't, I don't, we'll see. Like, we have to figure out what the actual policy is going to be about. Yeah, I was just curious. Okay. Game coins. It would be fun, but yeah. i want to be able to credibly get on stage when i'm asked that question and say i don't own these you know like i i don't own one um well it's gonna suck because they're gonna graduate and we're staring at a chart and i'll be like man i can't even touch these things well you know there are lots of anons and pseudonymous accounts in the world and um yeah i mean the risk you take is like for sure 100 like if you're caught doing anything like that you need to be immediately no fuck that i'm not fucking with it i'll tell you why and where i asked about og because i'm gonna buy a chunk og you know a little bit over time because in four years i think i'm like gonna have Lambos. So that's the only thing I'm concerned about. Yeah, just DCA. Is that a unit of measurement? Yeah, it's Lambo. Well, I'm doing Bitcoin stuff, you know, for making games. I'm getting off Bitcoin. I'm getting into GigaChats. I'm still, yeah, Lambo. You're in that space. Lambo, yeah, it used to be Maserati when I first started. But since we're in this space, Lambo is now a currency. It's got to be Lambo. Yeah, it's got to be Lambo. No, but seriously, that's why I said that. The only thing I'm thinking is number one. I just want OG token. That's it. I mean, the shit coins and the trade, it's going to suck, man. Seriously, looking at the charts, like GigaChat, if one game is like Tiger goes off and promotes a game and it goes crazy, it's going to be be like oh man i really want this i think people every time it happens you're making money with with og that's right yeah and you're not getting the the same level of like multiple exposure but you're getting the you're getting the risk adjusted basket which is kind of better because like you don't you don't want the downside of all those right and the only way you could trade those and actually make clear the 10Xs is if you're trading 24-7 and you'll never be able to do your job. Yeah. No job, no token. So, yeah, no job, no token. That is always an option. You know, you could always just retire at some point and just trade game coins. Yeah, right. Then you're in the clear. You know, that is – you could just opt out and be like shit man this is an opportunity of a lifetime i gotta go yeah fuck you guys i'm out no no yeah so og is like basically it's like s&p 500 you put money in you just never touch it you just leave it just goes up that's it so that's why i asked so kyle be able to tell us know like when time comes yeah yeah yeah we have to have an official policy on it so yeah 40 Lambos okay I think we have the other media I'm done by the way I don't have any more questions yeah me too but reactions on that idea of the launch I'm all for it I like it because I'm all for it's like quote unquote testing and prod and there's really no and this gives us the opportunity to bring like you said bring in people because they're just they're gonna find everything we didn't but we want them to specifically we've learned from d3 whatever went wrong we've learned from virtuals whatever went wrong we've learned from boop whatever went wrong we don't know what can go wrong here so this gives us the op it's qa that's what it is they're gonna yeah my sense is like in terms of what goes wrong with the community and whatever plays out in prod that's like more of um the stuff that like boop is changing things and they're getting you know shit for this and things for that that stuff we're not going to be able to fix any of that from doing this for two to three days this is like more just like a pure technical um prod qa pass which i think is helpful but but we won't you know we're still going to have like this won't tell us for example like how people are going to game the system because there won't be enough users using the system we're not going to tell anybody about it this is more like it yeah this is like it all works in prod and it seemed like nothing went wrong and we all got like some rewards and whatever that's what this is yeah and polish i like it i think it's a great idea now how does this work it went i mean someone's gonna see it someone's gonna link it people are gonna come here and they're gonna have an opinion they're gonna think it's our launch how do you handle that yeah so we i just wanted to. They're going to think it's our launch. How do you handle that? Yeah, so I just wanted to validate that you guys think it's an interesting approach, and then I think we can hash out the details. The simplest thing, I think, would be to just, like, call it an alpha. Yeah, put a disclaimer on it. Yeah, put a disclaimer on the top of the page. Call it an alpha, and don't tell people when the alpha is over or what's coming. And lock down every – you see all the tokens. you can search all the tokens people can add games um but no one can launch any tokens except for whatever this one random token is and we should make sure that one random token is something that we really don't think is going to run like it really does look like a test coin um i don't i don't know which one we should launch on so if you guys have any ideas like it's definitely like not a top market cap token it's like some random token we find that we think is you know what about literally like a test coin i don't know this is going to be a weird suggestion what about using jonah's blue that's not a test coin that's something that jonah will go and run i don't want it to well okay all right well he can't run it he's not but okay all right we'll have to look i don't know we could talk about the next meeting i mean we just look at the list and just pick one no i i don't yeah i don't need to pull the marketing it's it's not like it's the opposite of marketing i don't want it to go viral so so anyway i don't tell scott yeah you're gonna start hyping it up like i don't know the point is like yeah i wouldn't pick anything because then jonah will be like i had the first coin on open game protocol like my token should go to 100 million or whatever right then he'll create a whole fucking narrative around it so i don't it needs to really be something that is like obviously not going anywhere so anyway if you have any ideas just let me know all right just so we'll pick a market cap that you're looking at and we'll find one i'm talking about like we have enough to graduate like this thing should not go above a million market cap because it goes above a million it's going to be on everybody's radar no the coin itself like what should we be looking at like a coin that's like like what like a million yeah so we're talking about a coin that is like probably about a million market cap because we don't allow you to make anything lower than that right yeah so we'll look at million market caps and see if it sparks out we'll just pick one Okay, cool Alright, let's hop to the next one Thanks guys Bye, cool, take this",
