  "full_text": "Daniel: the number of decimal points or whatever he was talking about right I'll double check with Daniel: him he's been Daniel: like he's been a Daniel: ramping up on getting into voting because we figured Daniel: let's give Meteora the chance to finally Daniel: give them the solution that they keep saying Carles Vallve: they're going to deliver and but yeah, but I'll, I'll, I'll, Carles Vallve: Bring him back to this. Carles Vallve: Okay, another thing I wanted to flag Carles Vallve: for you is we kicked off the renegotiations with Amplitude. Carles Vallve: Mm-hmm. Carles Vallve: And, yeah, we're paying them way too much money Carles Vallve: because we top-ticked it back in the Telegram days. Carles Vallve: yeah thinking we were locking in a bunch of savings but we spent a lot of money with them and um Carles Vallve: Basically, what we told them was, hey, we don't really want to pay for this at all. Carles Vallve: all, to be honest, because right now we have like no traffic or no traffic that we're monitoring. Carles Vallve: We essentially want to keep our data, so we're going to terminate this, or we need to come back. Carles Vallve: with a plan that's $1,000 a month max. Carles Vallve: And then the guy came back to us with like a, went from like a 500k a year plan to like Carles Vallve: a $350,000 a year plan, so he just thinks he's in a regular negotiation. Carles Vallve: didn't land so so we're serious we're like no no no really like we're Carles Vallve: I really am going to shut it off if we if there's literally no reason. Carles Vallve: for us to be locking in $350,000 a year for what we're using it for right now. Carles Vallve: So, and we just don't have, we don't even have the cash right now to be doing that. Carles Vallve: Like, it's not, we're not in the position we were in before. Carles Vallve: So, so my take is like, Carles Vallve: It could be painful, but we're in this weird – they're always happy Carles Vallve: to take your money Carles Vallve: once you start growing Carles Vallve: and call them Carles Vallve: and ask to work out a plan Carles Vallve: and they'll always give us Carles Vallve: the same sort of bulk discounting stuff that they're not going to penalize us for having terminated pre Carles Vallve: But because they're a public company, they're really averse to losing customers. Carles Vallve: because it shows up in their numbers. Carles Vallve: So the salespeople push really hard to just keep the contract. Carles Vallve: Because I guess like their job is judged partially based on churn. Carles Vallve: which creates a really weird set of incentives Carles Vallve: and so Carles Vallve: So, like, my plan is to really hold them to that, which is, like, we – Carles Vallve: they get us a contract that's like a thousand dollars a month or we just Carles Vallve: terminate and just so you know so what would I Carles Vallve: that would mean Carles Vallve: if we terminate Carles Vallve: obviously Carles Vallve: we need to look Carles Vallve: for alternatives Carles Vallve: yes Carles Vallve: maybe Carles Vallve: I mean, I also feel that like a lot of the stuff we're doing is not, I mean, we've Carles Vallve: had this discussion before, but like there's enough, the leverage is not so Carles Vallve: much in the UI and telegram and almost none of the leverage is Carles Vallve: in the UI on what we're doing now. Carles Vallve: It's like the UI has to be sufficiently good, but if we're Carles Vallve: spending a bunch of time running AB tests on UI, Carles Vallve: we're probably not making any progress. Carles Vallve: We probably have to be innovating Carles Vallve: on the incentives, like virtuals, right? Carles Vallve: This is through blockchain data, Carles Vallve: be far more valuable to us right so I'm kind of wondering how valuable it's going to be Carles Vallve: in general it's not that it doesn't have any value it's just like it's in web 2 it's Carles Vallve: it's like 98% of your analytics value Carles Vallve: and it feels like it might end up being like 5%. Carles Vallve: I think it is important for us to know how many people are coming. Carles Vallve: I don't know how important it is anymore to know with exhausting Carles Vallve: of detail what they're doing. Because their activity will show on Carles Vallve: blockchain that's right the ultimate conversion shows in the blockchain and Carles Vallve: It's kind of useful to know where somebody falls off in a flow, but in many cases, it Carles Vallve: It's less about quality of the UI and more about just, like, what's compelling. Carles Vallve: So that's if I'm comfortable going out without Carles Vallve: I mean, I'm not saying we have to be naked in terms of analytics, but, like, I'm comfortable going out without Amazon. Carles Vallve: and just having some very basic tracking Carles Vallve: with Google Analytics or something. Carles Vallve: and scrapping a lot of taxonomy and then leaning in very, Carles Vallve: obviously on the blockchain side, I don't want to sacrifice Carles Vallve: anything. Carles Vallve: We need to know all the stuff around how the tokens are trading. Carles Vallve: But just so you know where things are sitting with them. Speaker SPEAKER_01: we want to use it later, there's nothing stopping us from just setting up a contract and sorting it out. Carles Vallve: Yeah, exactly. We could always Carles Vallve: add on telemetry if we see that Carles Vallve: that there's an area where we're curious. Speaker SPEAKER_01: Cool, okay. Carles Vallve: Those are the two things I wanted to kick off with. Carles Vallve: But you can just go ahead now. Carles Vallve: Cool. Carles Vallve: Well, Kai is finally out. Carles Vallve: It's frustrating because when I met with him in the morning, Carles Vallve: He showed me a staking transaction. Carles Vallve: that he had done to show that, Carles Vallve: okay, we already had that part on the front end, Carles Vallve: and the new and upcoming coins basically because the upcoming coins Carles Vallve: hasn't been implemented. Carles Vallve: And Kai was like, yeah, Carls can do that in a few minutes. Carles Vallve: So I'm in that state of, well, yeah, in theory it works, but... Carles Vallve: I needed to see her work, and Kai's not here anymore, and it was... Carles Vallve: when I tried to do the Carles Vallve: staking, and part of it was Carles Vallve: simply like we're meeting and he's like, well, you know, I'm on the bus. Carles Vallve: I'm going to run. Carles Vallve: So I'm like, well, but can I do the staking? Carles Vallve: And he's like, yes. Carles Vallve: You just have to send yourself tokens to your profile, Carles Vallve: to your wallet profile, Carles Vallve: which makes sense. Carles Vallve: However, the wallet, the dev wallet has dozens Carles Vallve: to find a token that would be recognized. Carles Vallve: And by that time, Carles Vallve: Kive had disappeared, so it was like, well, for all I, so it was very, like, Carles Vallve: convenient for him to all of a sudden disappear. Carles Vallve: knocking him out, he's also now just been able to Carles Vallve: to finish the staking and he's starting to vote but I'm hoping Carles Vallve: and finalize the swapping on all three types of tokens. Carles Vallve: That's, yeah, sorry to hear that, that's like a, that's definitely a pattern. Carles Vallve: swooping in and doing a lot Carles Vallve: and then swooping out Carles Vallve: with really extremely inconvenient timing. Carles Vallve: priority over whatever he's supposed to be getting done. Carles Vallve: I don't know, can't expect anything different at this point, but I, okay, so it sounds like Carles Vallve: but a handoff Carles Vallve: and like Carles Vallve: Carlos and Carles Vallve: Bruce being Carles Vallve: somewhat in the Carles Vallve: back end and some Carles Vallve: one-on-the-path is now underway so we're not like we're not in this at least Carles Vallve: if nothing else like next week and even for the rest of this week we're not stuck in the water Carles Vallve: Right, where we would have been if they didn't get up to speed, Carles Vallve: where it's just like we're just doing – Carles Vallve: bunch of smart contractor client stuff with no ability to touch the back end like they're they're in there now Carles Vallve: which is the first steps for us to be able to make any decisions about like Carles Vallve: the broader structure of the theme is to have some more redundancy on what people are able Carles Vallve: to do Carles Vallve: and be Carles Vallve: comfortable Carles Vallve: and you Carles Vallve: know so Carles Vallve: anyway it's Carles Vallve: all it's all interrelated. That's good. Carles Vallve: Okay. Unknown Speaker: All right. Carles Vallve: What's your take on that? Carles Vallve: the timing of this vertical slice then based on the latest? Carles Vallve: And if it doesn't get done in on Carles Vallve: Friday, like it can't be, I mean, I'd probably be better in Carles Vallve: form to make the claim that I'm about to make in four hours or five hours, whatever. Carles Vallve: I think it's way possible and that if it doesn't happen on Friday, it should happen Monday or Tuesday. Carles Vallve: It seems like you've really been able to get back into Carles Vallve: working closely managing engineers yeah I mean it was it was Carles Vallve: a little bit of a ramp up because I had been so separated while all this thing was being Carles Vallve: built but over the last couple of days like yeah I feel I feel like I'm more Carles Vallve: you know at the very least aware of what the pieces are and what what the problem is with Carles Vallve: is very, very, you know, hands-on monitoring all the time, Carles Vallve: blowing up. So it's so it requires burning the candle at both ends. Carles Vallve: So it's not infinitely sustainable, but I'm fine for now. Carles Vallve: Damon comes next week. What we were talking about with Mark... Carles Vallve: to have me share some of the managing stuff that Daemon is doing Carles Vallve: because we need him coding. Speaker SPEAKER_01: That's what I was thinking, too, because I think when we were running the tightest Carles Vallve: engineering was actually when you were the most involved when i reflect on like the last year and a half Carles Vallve: I think that there's less telephones Carles Vallve: because you're not managing specs through another layer Carles Vallve: And Damon just has a lot in it. Carles Vallve: It creates even more confusion and missed Carles Vallve: dropped balls and stuff so it gets things done faster because you're in a loop and then i'm Carles Vallve: I think, like you said, Damon has been a bottleneck for sure. Carles Vallve: Yeah. Carles Vallve: the other with the other bottleneck being kai because he's just been we keep putting everything important sequentially on it Carles Vallve: play and that's what this week has been about is like starting to make sure that Brace and Carles Vallve: And then hopefully Santosh, everyone can touch everything. Carles Vallve: So he's no longer a bottleneck. Carles Vallve: Kai can't be a bottleneck. Carles Vallve: Yeah. Carles Vallve: If we solve those two problems, we solve probably like half the space Speaker SPEAKER_01: I think so. Carles Vallve: I think so. Carles Vallve: So, yeah. Carles Vallve: So, yeah. Carles Vallve: So, yeah. Carles Vallve: Once I have Daemon here that is in my time zone and I can just Carles Vallve: really go in there and ask really like like give me 15 minutes of your time and walk me Carles Vallve: A to C on this thing so that I can explain it that's like gonna be probably the biggest missing piece Unknown Speaker: Yeah. Carles Vallve: And we're going to have to see like what. Carles Vallve: When Damon coming back, like what everything is like in his world. Carles Vallve: probability will reduce, so we'll have to be really smart about how we use this time. Carles Vallve: Yeah, hopefully you're in a position where you can, like, Carles Vallve: get normal sleep because I feel like that was already an occasional challenge for him and then Carles Vallve: sometimes with kids it can be really rough some people get lucky and like babies sleep really well and Carles Vallve: And other people have, you know, just really, really tough times. Carles Vallve: but um okay so look that's yeah because i've been really happy with like Carles Vallve: all things considered Carles Vallve: how things are going Carles Vallve: and I feel like Carles Vallve: you have Carles Vallve: a skill set Carles Vallve: that like, you know, that is unique on the team Carles Vallve: actually do a good job of getting everybody organized you know even even Damon with Carles Vallve: his ability to understand and grasp so many things I think sometimes glosses over some of the details Carles Vallve: because if he were to do it himself, he'd be able to fill them in. Carles Vallve: But we have a team that really requires – Carles Vallve: every single thing to be spelled out at the moment, so yeah. Carles Vallve: I think, I think it's been, I've been happy with like the last few days and how that's Carles Vallve: So I think you're right, I think we should, and it shouldn't be surprising because it's Carles Vallve: like I think you did a good job of getting everybody aligned Carles Vallve: and working on shipping the thing. Carles Vallve: And so that's where I think... Carles Vallve: it makes sense for you to be spending a lot of your time and yeah, Carles Vallve: Yeah, I mean, more broadly, like... Carles Vallve: We, I've, you know, like, Carles Vallve: last few weeks, I guess I've kind of internalized the opportunity Carles Vallve: cost of having not been out and Carles Vallve: Like I mentioned the other day, you know, having looked at like the numbers and then just saying Carles Vallve: like wow okay if we're out we're like probably top four or five we're we're talking about a hundred Carles Vallve: with $500,000 a day Carles Vallve: in revenue Carles Vallve: depending on the day Carles Vallve: and whatever. Carles Vallve: Dude, it's killing Carles Vallve: Realizing the weight of that has like amped up the stress. Carles Vallve: on my end about like feeling like we're just not making fast enough progress because Carles Vallve: once the cost of not being able to get that high, Carles Vallve: it's like, Carles Vallve: it really makes you and I don't think it's delusion I think it's it's just a Carles Vallve: truth and in a weird way you know we kick this thing off and Carles Vallve: in February, like the meme market, meme coin market, Carles Vallve: which is kind of like beginning to deflate rapidly. Carles Vallve: But I don't think it's necessarily that since then Carles Vallve: over the last four months that like the outlook for meme coins has changed Carles Vallve: a whole lot. I think it's changed a little bit, but not any more than we really expected. Carles Vallve: In fact, some of these big ones, like Trump, are still doing probably better Carles Vallve: than most people would have expected four months ago when things started deflating. So I think that Carles Vallve: the thing that I've realized is that Carles Vallve: every time some new Solana lawn Carles Vallve: launchpad or product launches, they just keep kind of taking liquidity and then pumped up Carles Vallve: all the revenue they make and they keep in their Carles Vallve: priseries is sucking liquidity Carles Vallve: out from all the Solana Carles Vallve: creators and so like the longer this stuff goes on and you're not out also like the Carles Vallve: more the more liquidity begins to deflate from Carles Vallve: a particular chain. Carles Vallve: Like you get these Carles Vallve: wealth creation moments Carles Vallve: like Solana went up in price Carles Vallve: Then people said, wow, okay, I don't have that many games left on Solana. Carles Vallve: So they start gambling in the pump fund casino. Carles Vallve: And then Solana takes a billion dollars of liquidity out of the ecosystem, which doesn't Carles Vallve: doesn't seem like that much, but I think it's more than people think because so much of the trades are back Carles Vallve: and forth with low fees, that a lot of it is just money shuffling around, right? Carles Vallve: Sometimes it seems like, oh, there's a trillion dollars going on in blockchain, but the reality Carles Vallve: a trillion dollars Carles Vallve: and get it out Carles Vallve: that's the market cap Carles Vallve: based on the price Carles Vallve: if everyone were able Carles Vallve: to sell at the Carles Vallve: current prices for all the assets, which is just not the case. So, it's Carles Vallve: really hard to gauge like how much how much actual money is in is in the salami because Carles Vallve: ecosystem and these other ecosystems because we look at trading volumes and it's always so impressive but like the cost Carles Vallve: to move these these this money around now is so low that you can be moving hundreds of Carles Vallve: the dollar like believe can do a hundred million dollars in volume in a day and it's like how does that Carles Vallve: even possible? Well, because Carles Vallve: they're only taking, you know, 2% Carles Vallve: out, so Carles Vallve: it's like these people Carles Vallve: are, you know, the fee Carles Vallve: they're low it's not revenue it's trading volume so um i i guess i guess for Carles Vallve: what I'm getting at Carles Vallve: is like Carles Vallve: I don't know Carles Vallve: the point where Carles Vallve: there's Carles Vallve: the liquidity Carles Vallve: in Solana Carles Vallve: is just like Carles Vallve: exhausting Carles Vallve: But it does feel like it's going to come to me just as a psychotherapist. Carles Vallve: type of thing. And it probably is in the summer. Carles Vallve: That's kind of my take, just reading the vibes in the room. Carles Vallve: And so I just feel like, and I think we can weather Carles Vallve: through that and deal with it or whatever, virtuals Carles Vallve: other projects approve and if you do something interesting that adds value in some other way then like people will just keep Carles Vallve: keep coming and you get more shots at it. Carles Vallve: So I don't feel the need to time the market with what we're doing. Carles Vallve: But we definitely don't want to go out in the trough of that. Carles Vallve: I really feel like we need to get out the first version of this in June and Carles Vallve: I don't know, I feel like at this point... Carles Vallve: It's hard for me to... Carles Vallve: becoming increasingly difficult for me to go and just give like any deadline with any real Carles Vallve: Credibility. Carles Vallve: Yeah. Speaker SPEAKER_01: Credibility. Carles Vallve: And like I, but in some ways, Carles Vallve: weird way. I feel like I've always been trying to put a Carles Vallve: deadline based on this vertical slice, which always has been two weeks of Carles Vallve: But then the list of things that comes before these things has always grown. Carles Vallve: things have always never happened so what I really meant was like get the playable slice which was a Carles Vallve: two-week goal that could have happened if we did not do any of the other things. But Carles Vallve: which in a weird way, it's like, it's always been true Carles Vallve: that we've been two weeks away from this vertical slice. Carles Vallve: But instead, we did all these other things that maybe or maybe we shouldn't have done. Carles Vallve: that led us to take so long to get to this thing and now i'm glad because like there's a lot of Carles Vallve: a lot of naive things we did in the original design Carles Vallve: that I think the more I talked to token communities and others Carles Vallve: have caused problems and we could have learned those things in public or we could have learned Carles Vallve: them in private. Carles Vallve: And some set of them we learned in private, and some of them, you know, a good chunk Carles Vallve: to them that are better, that we learned in private, we're not getting sued by the Trumps. Carles Vallve: you know we are like like we're getting close to being able to do a deal with them like I'm Carles Vallve: I'm meeting with Eric soon, and we're not, and I think Carles Vallve: we figured out much better mechanics on like the, Carles Vallve: like we weren't even planning to do community distribution. Carles Vallve: out like anyone launched these tokens a couple months ago a lot of these things Carles Vallve: would have been huge mistakes and some of them would Carles Vallve: would have been one-way doors where like if we let anybody launch tokens I'd Carles Vallve: I think that would have went very poorly and it would have been very hard to walk back. Carles Vallve: I, you know, I'm glad, I'm glad I feel like now we're at this place Carles Vallve: where like the design is in a really interesting place. Carles Vallve: And the biggest risk with it would be that it would be too Carles Vallve: conservative, not too aggressive. Carles Vallve: In other words, the previous one was like Carles Vallve: too aggressive. Carles Vallve: in a sense like anyone can launch any token Carles Vallve: and it's wide open or whatever, right? Unknown Speaker: So... Carles Vallve: I guess, like, I'm anxious to get it out so that... Carles Vallve: we put our flag in the ground because I really do think this is like a Carles Vallve: shelling point. Carles Vallve: where as long as we have the coins out and the narrative out first, then all the capital flows to Carles Vallve: us and then no one else will really be able to do it and we'll have time to sort out a Carles Vallve: because we won't have time if I mean the markets move fast and if you fuck up and people you're Carles Vallve: to people Carles Vallve: they move on Carles Vallve: really quick Carles Vallve: within a week Carles Vallve: but as long Carles Vallve: as we get them Carles Vallve: to believe and stay believing in the narrative and fix the things that we need to fix, then Carles Vallve: I think we have weeks and months to get like all the game content in and a lot Carles Vallve: lot of the other things that we're worried about that are big and hard, a lot of those Carles Vallve: things could take time to happen. Carles Vallve: like people would be okay with it as long as price is okay. Carles Vallve: Yeah. Carles Vallve: Yeah. Speaker SPEAKER_01: That's the big if. Carles Vallve: Yeah. Carles Vallve: And I've started to realize that price is more dependent Carles Vallve: on the other things than even more dependent on some of the things that Carles Vallve: we like we're probably ahead in our thinking on a lot of the things that that Carles Vallve: that make these real ecosystems Carles Vallve: than any of these other launchers. Carles Vallve: coin shift and just said hey like there's a founder and they launch a coin and that's it you know Carles Vallve: kind of attached to their company but there's no mechanisms there's no we're coming up with all Carles Vallve: these mechanisms and all this other stuff and they had none of that they just like hey there's Carles Vallve: like a thing and you launch a coin and it's attached. Carles Vallve: to somebody's company and we'll figure out the rest later and um so that's Carles Vallve: But I think that that's okay. Carles Vallve: Like, I think that that's a... Carles Vallve: a good a good thing to some extent because will Carles Vallve: have a very Carles Vallve: credible like Carles Vallve: virtuals that'll Carles Vallve: make people look Carles Vallve: at this thing Carles Vallve: as like very Carles Vallve: credible like Carles Vallve: when people Carles Vallve: look at virtuals and all the design they've done around the thinking around the agents Carles Vallve: and the agent treasury and all this stuff. Carles Vallve: stuff, they're like, well, there's something, you know, this is a real experiment with real Carles Vallve: iteration happening. Carles Vallve: frequently that driving Carles Vallve: forward some sort of Carles Vallve: outcome and I don't Carles Vallve: know if it's going to Carles Vallve: work but there's some Carles Vallve: like 10% chance of something that it does. And therefore, I'll price it like this, because Carles Vallve: There's no one else in the world who's figuring out how self-sovereign agents Carles Vallve: have their own wallets and is iterating every week and has all the capital flowing into them. Carles Vallve: to figure it out. Carles Vallve: So it's just like this probabilistic bet that some smart people are willing to make. Carles Vallve: Yeah. And I feel like that's the position we could be in is like, Carles Vallve: the best outcome is like a or not the best outcome the best outcome is it all just works very quickly and Carles Vallve: yes the proof is in the pudding the second best outcome is oh wow this is a really Carles Vallve: interesting concept they're sort of like halfway there on having figured out every piece but like Carles Vallve: they keep iterating and they have all the capital like virtuals and because every week things keep getting better. Carles Vallve: Like the probability on this thing working over the next year is pretty high, so I'm going to park my money here. Carles Vallve: So those are the two good outcomes. Carles Vallve: I had a call with Taps from Jupiter. Carles Vallve: He's kind of meows number two. Carles Vallve: And his name is Real. Carles Vallve: He's Indian, so it's K-A-S-H. Carles Vallve: not cash CASH Carles Vallve: anyway Carles Vallve: why he I wanted to talk to him about doing a Jupiter game coin and he's actually on board which is a Carles Vallve: a big deal Carles Vallve: because I think Carles Vallve: Jupiter's a top Carles Vallve: four token Carles Vallve: in Solana Carles Vallve: so Carles Vallve: So, you know, we have all these meme coins on board, but now we have the number one call Carles Vallve: coin you can get in Solana that isn't Solana itself is Jupiter. Carles Vallve: and they said Carles Vallve: he's 100% they're going to do Carles Vallve: with us Carles Vallve: nice Carles Vallve: so Speaker SPEAKER_01: so we Speaker SPEAKER_01: really do Speaker SPEAKER_01: we have Carles Vallve: such a such a setup here it's just kind of crazy he did have good feedback like one of the interesting Carles Vallve: things about talking to him is all these mean coins have had different sort of distribution Carles Vallve: stories, whereas Jupiter, every coin has their own story, perhaps. Carles Vallve: how they did their air drops and how it came to be and how the community was formed or whatever. Carles Vallve: He had a really interesting experience. Carles Vallve: feedback on like how we should handle the claim mechanism and he's like you gotta be really careful not to Carles Vallve: call it airdrop. We keep calling it airdrop, but it's not airdrop, right? People have to come and claim it. Carles Vallve: That's true. Carles Vallve: so Carles Vallve: he was saying Carles Vallve: like Carles Vallve: this idea Carles Vallve: of getting to a Carles Vallve: 5% threshold Carles Vallve: to be a Carles Vallve: launcher is Carles Vallve: a really good idea. He thought this was very smart. But he thought that Carles Vallve: giving a broad distribution to the rest of the token holders might be a mistake. Carles Vallve: To the base coin holders? Carles Vallve: Yeah. Carles Vallve: We launched Juke GameCoin and then we have five points goes to the launchers and then Carles Vallve: he points goes to all the other Juke holders. Carles Vallve: There are a couple of things he pointed out. Carles Vallve: He said, one, for the 5% of token – Carles Vallve: the launchers that vote is like, Carles Vallve: you got to think if it's circulating supply or total supply. Carles Vallve: And I hadn't thought a lot about that because, you know, for the meme coins, in many cases, it's the same. Carles Vallve: But for people like them, they have a ton of lifestyles. Carles Vallve: lock token, because when we started doing protocols, there's a huge difference between Carles Vallve: between circulating supply and, and total supply. And he's like, so I think you should make it 5% Carles Vallve: of circulating supply because in some cases 5% of total supply Carles Vallve: buy might be like 15 or 20 percent of all the token which is probably going to get really hard to to Carles Vallve: do so that was the first really useful point of feedback that would be like a dumb Carles Vallve: mistake that I've made Carles Vallve: because talking to somebody Carles Vallve: throughout a token distribution, Carles Vallve: like it's obvious once he said, Carles Vallve: it, but something we didn't think about. So I don't know, does Carles Vallve: Does that make sense to you? Speaker SPEAKER_01: I think so. Carles Vallve: Yeah, I mean, the other thing that I think about is many of those base coins probably Carles Vallve: have terrible guinea coefficients. Carles Vallve: So like giving 15% to base coin holders Carles Vallve: how much of that is going to jump into like the top five coin holders. Carles Vallve: already, right? Carles Vallve: Like, if we gave 15% to Trump, Carles Vallve: Trump holders, how much is the Trump group itself getting and does it benefit us or no? Carles Vallve: I don't know. Unknown Speaker: Yeah. Carles Vallve: So he said. Carles Vallve: He's not opposed to paying whales. Carles Vallve: His bigger concern around the claim, first of all, he's like, Carles Vallve: to get in their wallet and know what it is so claims are better which we're already doing but he's Carles Vallve: you should never give anyone money Carles Vallve: if you don't give them enough. Carles Vallve: He said there's a very weird cycle Carles Vallve: thing that they've received with all the token launches they've done where like if you do Carles Vallve: someone money but you give them like less than ten dollars they just they they Carles Vallve: They feel entitled to what you've given them Carles Vallve: because you told them they deserved it, Carles Vallve: but they feel like you didn't give them enough. Carles Vallve: And if you give them nothing, then no one complains. Carles Vallve: was saying like you need to make sure he's like you got to model out how many people can Carles Vallve: I give, like, at least $100. And if I can't give them $100, then, like, I probably should Carles Vallve: even put them in the airdrop because what you really want to do is all you're doing is creating complaints Carles Vallve: Yeah, you're creating complaints and you're not creating fans in a real community. Carles Vallve: to create fans in a real community you need to make some people rich or make them a good chunk of money if you don't make Carles Vallve: make them rich. Carles Vallve: And then they become very grateful and they stay as holders. Carles Vallve: So he was just saying, look, you might want to consider just giving even more to the people Carles Vallve: launch the token but then the more you get to the launch of the token and the Carles Vallve: less there is left over to give it to the rest Carles Vallve: to the token holders Carles Vallve: and it kind of begs Carles Vallve: the question like Carles Vallve: do you just give Carles Vallve: the whole thing Carles Vallve: to like launchers Carles Vallve: or something, right? Carles Vallve: So that was also something I hadn't thought about that I think he Carles Vallve: he's right about, which is like, say you did do 5% threshold Carles Vallve: But then 20% of the game coin just went to those launchers. Carles Vallve: like you have way fewer people that from those those token communities that god Carles Vallve: it, but they'd be self-selected to be the people who took the initiative that Carles Vallve: care about the game coin are way less likely to Carles Vallve: sell and you'd make them a lot more money so they'd be much more loyal than Carles Vallve: giving them a small amount and then having all these other people, random people who Carles Vallve: at some that don't care, maybe just incidentally. Carles Vallve: So, so yeah, it's like, how do you, he's like, look, people have to think about their tokens Carles Vallve: just like NFTs, you kind of have to think about it as an art collector or an art salesperson Carles Vallve: gallery it's like you won't just sell it to anybody you have to like you're qualifying the cost of Carles Vallve: because if you sell the art to someone who's just going to dump it, then the value of the art goes down. Carles Vallve: If you want the value of the art to go up, you need to make sure just like the watch Carles Vallve: salesmen people and everything else. Carles Vallve: you're only selling it to people you know won't sell so the total token just Carles Vallve: distribution thing out. Carles Vallve: To your point, it's unfortunate, but like the whole Guinea coefficient thing, like how Carles Vallve: actually works is like a lot of times you want to give it to whales because Carles Vallve: they're just way less likely to dump and Carles Vallve: You're giving it to people who, just like famous artists, want to have billionaire Carles Vallve: is hold their part because they're not going to sell it. Speaker SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Carles Vallve: And so the value can continue to go up. Carles Vallve: So I don't, in our case, like, I guess the decision point on this, like, I Carles Vallve: I thought that was really good feedback and it makes sense based on what I've heard, but I don't think that we thought this Carles Vallve: through enough Carles Vallve: and it's Carles Vallve: I guess the Carles Vallve: point is like Carles Vallve: we should Carles Vallve: we should make Carles Vallve: a call, like, are we, you know, what Carles Vallve: What price would a token have to get to in many of the different market cap situations Carles Vallve: for these other people to get this 15% claim and be happy with it versus just Carles Vallve: annoyed or it doesn't even make sense or they're fighting it because they're like hey this is dumb look Carles Vallve: this thing has Carles Vallve: you can go claim Carles Vallve: your one dollar Carles Vallve: of the same coin Carles Vallve: who cares Carles Vallve: why are they Carles Vallve: doing this right Carles Vallve: yeah so Carles Vallve: that's or do you Carles Vallve: like, what would the distribution be? Is it launchers and some other group of people that Carles Vallve: you can reward much more heavily. Carles Vallve: That's what I thought. Carles Vallve: is useful from this conversation to figure out because he's much more thoughtful about this than the Carles Vallve: other token team to talk to who don't even really think about this stuff yeah that's Carles Vallve: actually really really really good points that he's making I'm gonna need Carles Vallve: to digest that Carles Vallve: because then Carles Vallve: yeah Carles Vallve: ways to maybe like definitely in like maybe even include Carles Vallve: Like, do we do anything for base coin holders at all, like any small percentage? Carles Vallve: Well, yeah, because if you increase the launchers pool, like say, hey, look, Carles Vallve: instead of 5%, 10%, now you have 10% left over Carles Vallve: for everybody else, in which case the rewards become even Carles Vallve: less significant. So it begs the question of like, why are you giving them anything at all? Yeah, right. That's Carles Vallve: But there may be another way of qualifying holders within the token pool Carles Vallve: that we think are high quality I just I haven't thought of one yet so like Carles Vallve: Launchers is a nice self-selecting mechanism. Carles Vallve: And then the bigger bag you give to the launchers, the more they're Carles Vallve: on the hook to go promote it anyway. Carles Vallve: And so the insight here is like, hopefully, Carles Vallve: 5% of the tokens or 5% of the circulating supply of tokens is pretty hard threshold Carles Vallve: to get to Carles Vallve: so you're getting Carles Vallve: enough for the community Carles Vallve: where like Carles Vallve: these are people Carles Vallve: who can go Carles Vallve: and move the needle Carles Vallve: It's not easy to just get to 5% on one of these large market cap tokens. Carles Vallve: For Jupiter to get to 5%, he thought we could do it to get 13% average participation. Carles Vallve: on their governance stuff, so he thought 5% is doable. Carles Vallve: It's going to take a lot of people coming and showing up. Carles Vallve: But he's going to give us access to all the channels. Carles Vallve: He's going to promote it in Meowth's account and Jupiter's account and everything else. Carles Vallve: that he thinks Carles Vallve: it's just Carles Vallve: going to Carles Vallve: happen Carles Vallve: but the Carles Vallve: point is Carles Vallve: if Carles Vallve: if you get those people signed up and vote and voting to launch, Carles Vallve: then you probably end up in a situation where if you give them a really Carles Vallve: big bag and then you put the lockup he said the lockup idea is a very good idea that we should 100% Carles Vallve: do that which is you get milestones Carles Vallve: based on market cap for the lockup for these people. Carles Vallve: And the bigger bag they have, the more they care about the lockup. Carles Vallve: So that's the other thing is like, if we just do the claim and everyone's getting like a dollar worth of Carles Vallve: stuff Carles Vallve: then no Carles Vallve: one cares Carles Vallve: about when Carles Vallve: the lock Carles Vallve: happens Carles Vallve: right Carles Vallve: but if Carles Vallve: If we just make it all launcher pool and these guys actually have a lot of money that they Carles Vallve: then they're going to have Carles Vallve: a lot of pressure to go Carles Vallve: and promote it to everyone Carles Vallve: in their community Carles Vallve: who didn't get Carles Vallve: a free a free claim and then if maybe the optics are better if if Carles Vallve: the launchers launched it and it's enough people from the community that Carles Vallve: everybody had their fair chance to be the people who launched Carles Vallve: the game point and it's a good chunk of them because it's five percent then all the people who didn't work Carles Vallve: involved with Carles Vallve: they can't Carles Vallve: really complain Carles Vallve: they didn't Carles Vallve: get anything Carles Vallve: and maybe Carles Vallve: they're less Carles Vallve: likely to Carles Vallve: complain if Carles Vallve: they get Carles Vallve: nothing versus if they got 50 cents is an interesting insight, right? Carles Vallve: guy makes like $10,000 on launching this thing and then a bunch of other people make $0.50, Carles Vallve: like what the hell Carles Vallve: happened here Carles Vallve: but if it's just Carles Vallve: the people who took Carles Vallve: the initiative Carles Vallve: to launch the game coin Carles Vallve: and make good money. Carles Vallve: And then everybody else didn't get anything Carles Vallve: because they didn't help. Carles Vallve: You might actually be in a much better Carles Vallve: situation Carles Vallve: psychologically Carles Vallve: so Carles Vallve: why Carles Vallve: Why not then give launchers a cool temperature, Carles Vallve: flat 10% instead of 5% and return the rest to the bonding curve. Carles Vallve: We could return to the bonding crew, it just... Carles Vallve: Or do we use it for... Carles Vallve: I don't understand Carles Vallve: the trade off of Carles Vallve: or it could go Carles Vallve: to the rewards Carles Vallve: right Speaker SPEAKER_01: yeah Carles Vallve: Or it could be give the launchers even more, Carles Vallve: give them 20%. Carles Vallve: Because at the end of the day, Carles Vallve: it's like, Carles Vallve: If we, the bonding curve people are kind of shitheads. Carles Vallve: That's kind of what we're learning. Carles Vallve: You look at all these other – I mean, if you go and look at all these other protocols, Carles Vallve: that are just launch pads Carles Vallve: that have launched recently. Carles Vallve: What you see time and time again Carles Vallve: is that Carles Vallve: you're gambling on who buys the supply first. Carles Vallve: And it's often these snipers increasingly, though. Carles Vallve: And they don't add a lot of value, they're just extracting, and you're helping to do Carles Vallve: about like the people who are actually in a position to add value it's the Carles Vallve: people from the original community so Carles Vallve: If you can, I don't know, that's the case for just giving them 20%. Carles Vallve: because basically like Carles Vallve: if you enrich a bunch of people Carles Vallve: from the juke game coin Carles Vallve: or the Trump that took the initiative to go and vote to get the thing launched, then they're going to be Carles Vallve: grateful that you made them a lot of money, and they're going to make sure that this is Carles Vallve: a thing that everybody in that community knows about. Carles Vallve: And if you put it on an unlocked schedule where they're forced to pump the price because they have bigger and bigger Carles Vallve: your bags yeah I mean you have the exact people who are in the Carles Vallve: position to promote the thing with the biggest bags, whereas anyone who buys on the bonding Carles Vallve: Rando who's Carles Vallve: either got a Carles Vallve: sniper set up Carles Vallve: or whatever Carles Vallve: And then you solve the governance part too, Ian, which is pretty interesting. If 20% of Carles Vallve: the supply is held by people who actually hold the original coin. Speaker SPEAKER_01: and have opted in to thinking the game point is a good idea. Carles Vallve: They have a vested interest, yeah, they've clearly shown it. Carles Vallve: You have a very strong interest in governing the thing properly. Carles Vallve: to think it's just more legit so so yeah the more i thought about this i was like maybe the whole he's Carles Vallve: like you always got to do smaller, smaller claims and more directed Carles Vallve: claims. And so, you know, the drawback of this is you're going to miss a bunch of people Carles Vallve: but you're self-selecting for people Carles Vallve: who actually think this is a good idea. Carles Vallve: Now, there's going to be mercenaries in there too, Carles Vallve: because once people learn how this works, Carles Vallve: there's going to be some people who are just like, Carles Vallve: this is a way to get a bunch of supply of a thing very easily. Carles Vallve: And so you'll get people who are farming these other tokens, for sure. Speaker SPEAKER_01: I don't think there's really anything we can do about that. Carles Vallve: That's just the way the world works. Carles Vallve: Every system eventually has people that will try to exploit it. Carles Vallve: Yeah, but we're trying, the point he made to me that I thought was really interesting Carles Vallve: He's like, you actually want every community should be like a little bit like different. Carles Vallve: Like you don't want the community for the game coin Carles Vallve: to be the same community as the base coin. Carles Vallve: because most people that have the base coin Carles Vallve: don't care about the game coin. Carles Vallve: But you need to figure out who are the people Carles Vallve: are that care about the game coin and make sure that they're very richly rewarded so that they Carles Vallve: they go do all the work or that some of them go do the work. Carles Vallve: He's like, it's, you know, it's 1% that go do the work. Carles Vallve: But you make money for 100 people, and one or two of them Carles Vallve: are actually going to go out of their way to really Carles Vallve: promote the thing. Speaker SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Carles Vallve: That's. Carles Vallve: And yeah. Carles Vallve: So. Carles Vallve: I mean, I don't know that we give it back to the bonding curve. Carles Vallve: No, in fact, now the argument is, should we make Carles Vallve: the nest egg of like that Carles Vallve: that little piggy bank that people are looking for would be so big Carles Vallve: like what's the number that is the optimal size of reward that gets Carles Vallve: people optimally Carles Vallve: invested. Carles Vallve: It's a 10, Carles Vallve: it's a 20 Carles Vallve: because all like Carles Vallve: Am I making sense? Speaker SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it makes sense. Carles Vallve: So like Ego did the launch pad a few weeks ago where you can launch anybody's social profile and 50% Carles Vallve: goes to the Carles Vallve: person who owns Carles Vallve: a social profile Carles Vallve: when they claim. Carles Vallve: I don't Carles Vallve: know that we're in a situation where we want to give that moment Carles Vallve: much because these could end up being much bigger I think than any individual random social profile Carles Vallve: So it's more about dollar value than percentage. Carles Vallve: And then I think about these market cap gates Carles Vallve: that you've been thinking about on the lockup Carles Vallve: timing and I think that's where the rubber meets the road Carles Vallve: on this stuff which is like if it gets to a million dollar market cap this Carles Vallve: is 20%, say we give only launchers as 20%. Carles Vallve: that's $200,000, that's a value that's helpful. Carles Vallve: by those people Carles Vallve: but like that's not Carles Vallve: the final gate Carles Vallve: I don't know Carles Vallve: were you thinking Carles Vallve: the final gate Carles Vallve: is 10 million market cap Carles Vallve: or what Carles Vallve: where do we Carles Vallve: we Carles Vallve: we Carles Vallve: we didn't Carles Vallve: I Carles Vallve: I was going to ask if we should go as high as 500 million actually. Carles Vallve: Oh, wow. Carles Vallve: That's really high. Carles Vallve: Yeah. Carles Vallve: Yeah, I mean, it's hard to say, right? Carles Vallve: the market's wildly fluctuating. Carles Vallve: For me, in CoinLaunchpads, it seems like Carles Vallve: things keep getting smaller and smaller but then you have the beliefs that Carles Vallve: stuff. Like 900,000, yeah. Yeah, and there may Carles Vallve: coin hit like over a hundred million or something or 200 million at one point so like i don't know i Carles Vallve: it's hard Carles Vallve: it's hard to say Speaker SPEAKER_01: I just want to say Speaker SPEAKER_01: like Speaker SPEAKER_01: like for me Speaker SPEAKER_01: I think of it as Carles Vallve: like a very Carles Vallve: exponential curve Carles Vallve: in the sense Carles Vallve: that you know Carles Vallve: it's just Carles Vallve: Just like balancing game difficulty, you make it more attractive. Carles Vallve: attractive at first and then that difficulty starts to ramp up, but the reward also gets Carles Vallve: you know proportionally bigger so 500 million would just be like it's Carles Vallve: to unlock obviously. Carles Vallve: Yeah. Carles Vallve: Like... Carles Vallve: Exactly. Carles Vallve: But... Carles Vallve: And that happens below that or something? Carles Vallve: And it's... Carles Vallve: What? Speaker SPEAKER_01: So, yeah. Carles Vallve: So it's like you started, so you start at 120 and, you know, Carles Vallve: You know, you have, there's the five drops, you know, graduation, Carles Vallve: month one, month two, month three, and month four. Carles Vallve: Each one of those goes from 120 at the start to... Carles Vallve: to 250, to 1 million, to 10 million, to 100 million. Carles Vallve: or something like that. Carles Vallve: So that you either wait the entire five months and get the entire supply or you, like, Carles Vallve: hit it out of the park and get to 500 million, but 500 million might be too ambitious. Carles Vallve: At the end of the day, like, I mean, it's meme... Carles Vallve: I don't know whether to think of them as meme coins in this perspective or not, but five months? Carles Vallve: It's a long time Carles Vallve: For the lock-up, right? Yeah Speaker SPEAKER_01: Yeah, for a meme coin. Carles Vallve: I think it's reasonable though, especially if we're giving more of the supply. Carles Vallve: these people this is another reason that I think that's just right which is like if we Carles Vallve: If we give it to everybody, then five months is like, dude, it's a dollar, who cares? Carles Vallve: even if it goes to 100 million, Carles Vallve: it might not be enough money for most of these people to care. Carles Vallve: going to do anything to move the lockup. But if you get like a hundred people who all have Carles Vallve: hundreds of thousands of dollars on the line. Carles Vallve: If they hit the biggest numbers, then everyone starts Carles Vallve: really move yeah yeah and they have the the ability to move too Carles Vallve: Yeah, so look, I... Carles Vallve: I like this. Yeah, I like this approach. I think 500 seems really steep. Carles Vallve: just based on where things are at right now, Carles Vallve: but we can always adjust. Carles Vallve: I feel like a hundred is like ambitious Carles Vallve: and won't be seen as crazy. Speaker SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Carles Vallve: That's kind of where my head is at. Carles Vallve: a hundred is like Carles Vallve: damn that's a Carles Vallve: runner that's huge Carles Vallve: nowadays you know Carles Vallve: nothing goes to Carles Vallve: a hundred anymore Carles Vallve: these things Carles Vallve: like hit 10 Carles Vallve: and that's kind of Carles Vallve: the permanence Carles Vallve: for all these meme coins Carles Vallve: but then yeah Carles Vallve: things get to 100%. Carles Vallve: that are really good, like Belie's LaunchCoin past 100. Carles Vallve: So 100 seems like very, very Carles Vallve: vicious, and people won't just scoff Carles Vallve: at it. They're like, okay, that's possible. Carles Vallve: But Carles Vallve: 500 seems like we're going to get a lot of like just but it was just like no Carles Vallve: be oh well like that's yeah I think you're right that would be exaggeration um Carles Vallve: But yeah, I mean, the good thing about 100 is that it's Carles Vallve: CC de Grock Carles Vallve: it's 0, 20, 40, 60 Carles Vallve: 80 and 100 Carles Vallve: it Carles Vallve: so Carles Vallve: yeah Carles Vallve: and then Carles Vallve: if you Carles Vallve: make Carles Vallve: if you get to 100, the launchers made 20 million if they held. Carles Vallve: Which is a shit ton of money. Carles Vallve: I mean, depending on how they divided it up. Carles Vallve: up for someone like Jupiter, where 5% means maybe getting hundreds of people involved Carles Vallve: We don't know, but like there could be whales that make a lot of money on that. Unknown Speaker: Yeah. Carles Vallve: Okay. Carles Vallve: Yeah, I think this is interesting because it creates Carles Vallve: creates a real, it's much more likely to create a real community instead of just trying to Carles Vallve: Yeah, whenever you get these airdrop rewards that are too many people he's right if you just look back like the last couple years Carles Vallve: No one thanks you when you just give everybody in the community a little bit of money. Carles Vallve: they don't they don't care the only things that get published to the timeline are when you make when you make Carles Vallve: some people Carles Vallve: a very real Carles Vallve: amount of money Speaker SPEAKER_01: and then some Carles Vallve: people will Carles Vallve: complain that Carles Vallve: they shouldn't Carles Vallve: have they Carles Vallve: should have Carles Vallve: been included like oh i should have been included in that or whatever but like that's better than the Carles Vallve: when you just don't pay people enough for anyone to care yeah it's much better to to having missed out than to Carles Vallve: having gotten Carles Vallve: a crappy Carles Vallve: number. Carles Vallve: There was Carles Vallve: What could have been Carles Vallve: is more attractive. Carles Vallve: It's just how different Carles Vallve: the different market caps Carles Vallve: and the different Carles Vallve: base tokens are. Carles Vallve: So that's Carles Vallve: It's really crazy. Carles Vallve: I've been trying to get like a distribution chart of marketing. Carles Vallve: But I got sidetracked, but I've got like half of the query written in Dune. Carles Vallve: because I figure if I can see all the meme coin market caps in one single curve, we Carles Vallve: You can make a, like, okay, these numbers make sense. Carles Vallve: yeah Carles Vallve: it's Carles Vallve: I think Carles Vallve: it's fine to just do the 100 million sort of terminus to lock up for everything and then Carles Vallve: just go out with Carles Vallve: it and just see Carles Vallve: we can't live Carles Vallve: perfectly the enemy Carles Vallve: of good here Carles Vallve: and then we just Carles Vallve: got to get out Carles Vallve: with a simplistic Carles Vallve: that seems reasonable Carles Vallve: and then creates incentives we like. Carles Vallve: And then when people are like, Carles Vallve: hey man, I just launched Carles Vallve: troll coin it's a five million dollar market cap coin and you're telling me i have to get to 100 million Carles Vallve: and for the games, it's like, well, I don't know, try harder. Carles Vallve: You know, it's just funny. Carles Vallve: It's like, whatever, you got it. Carles Vallve: to go make a lot of games Carles Vallve: go figure it out Carles Vallve: and then troll coin will grow too Carles Vallve: and it might even be possible to Carles Vallve: to multiply you know the value of some of these base coins by by many multiples if you Carles Vallve: create a lot of really interesting games and you get a lot of heat around a game ecosystem maybe that does make one Carles Vallve: of these other meme coins run. Carles Vallve: I mean, it wouldn't be surprising. Carles Vallve: If this really works, that should be the case. Carles Vallve: where someone revives a kind of like half-dead meme coin Carles Vallve: and they grow at many multiples because a new narrative formed around the games should be possible. Carles Vallve: Yeah. Unknown Speaker: So. Unknown Speaker: Yeah. Carles Vallve: Yeah. Carles Vallve: Yeah. Carles Vallve: Okay, those are the major things. Carles Vallve: So just steering towards Carles Vallve: this I guess we have on the fees side I think you and I talked about doing Carles Vallve: doing 2% I don't know if you like relayed all this stuff to Brice I think we can get away with it I Carles Vallve: think once we get big basically the game we have to play is you have to keep adjusting the liquidity pool Carles Vallve: to be competitive before someone just goes and... Carles Vallve: lowers the fees more. But that's okay, because the bigger you get, the more volume you're doing. Carles Vallve: the more the absolute dollars are coming in anyway so as you're adjusting the fees lower like Carles Vallve: It's more like you're asymptoting on the amount of revenue you're capturing, not like you're losing Carles Vallve: If you're doing it right. Carles Vallve: Yeah. Carles Vallve: So. Unknown Speaker: Yeah. Carles Vallve: But I think. Carles Vallve: I did relay that to Breeze, it's in the whimsical, everything adds up to the 2%. Carles Vallve: belief changed Carles Vallve: their fee structure Carles Vallve: so that 70% Carles Vallve: goes to creators Carles Vallve: now Carles Vallve: I don't Carles Vallve: I don't think Carles Vallve: we need to do that and I'm not sure I think part of the reason they did that is because a lot of people were completely Carles Vallve: that originally the fees weren't like being rewarded properly. Carles Vallve: to the creator. Carles Vallve: So a lot of creators are complaining that they weren't getting what they expected. Carles Vallve: expected Carles Vallve: so I Carles Vallve: don't Carles Vallve: think we Carles Vallve: need to Carles Vallve: make Carles Vallve: I feel like the reason they made that change is Carles Vallve: unrelated to us and in part because they were using Carles Vallve: damn dmv1 and when they switched to dmv2 the Carles Vallve: I agree. I think that's the way to go. Carles Vallve: All right, Justin. Carles Vallve: And I actually really want to get back to Breeze. Carles Vallve: He's been waiting for a while for an answer. Carles Vallve: makes sense yeah just please get him updated on the latest economic stuff we talked to here since Carles Vallve: yeah um or and i guess the cool thing about doing the launchers only getting this stuff is it's like a Carles Vallve: somewhat of a reduction in scope if we don't have two pools and simpler UI. And, uh, Carles Vallve: But yeah, we're removing a whole set of claims. Carles Vallve: Yeah, okay. Carles Vallve: So we'll change the model and the banner to be now about Carles Vallve: sure skid 10 20 percent do we fail fall 25 i think 20 Carles Vallve: percent is actually good yeah all right weighty amount of it's a legit like it's a challenge Carles Vallve: on this thing. Carles Vallve: Yeah. Carles Vallve: Okay. Carles Vallve: I'll run with that. Unknown Speaker: Cool. Carles Vallve: All right, Ian. Carles Vallve: All right, sir. Carles Vallve: Good talking to you. Carles Vallve: Bye. Unknown Speaker: Bye. Carles Vallve: What the fuck? Carles Vallve: What happens when no game has a vote for a given token? Matt: Продолжение следует...
