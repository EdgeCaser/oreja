============================================================

[0.0s - 69.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: points don't go to just the game first the the point is that there needs to be many points balances stored for each game for for each token that's attached to that game they're just separate that's the technical design there's no way around that so basically there's a player there's there's a game and there's a token and each and then there's points associated with that player-game-token pair, or triplet, for each day. That's how it works. That's it. And then the user count is also, there's a user count associated with the game-token pair for MAU and for DAU. Because we also need to track the traffic separately. So that's it. And it's very specific. But, like, so I don't know if that's in the spec or not exactly spelled out that clearly, but, like, that's what he needs to hear. Because I don't, this is so foundational so foundational like i don't want to dick around and spend another fiber there's no there's no lack of
[69.2s - 73.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: he's suggesting that we don't know exactly what the design should be and nothing could be further
[73.4s - 79.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: from the truth so i want to make sure he's 100 clear on this all right i'll go over it with him
[79.5s - 85.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: again uh tonight okay so why don't you repeat it back to me so i just understand that you guys know
[85.5s - 89.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: so i'm not if i'm not in that conversation that i'm 100 sure it's going to get done right this
[267.6s - 266.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Thank you. Tonight Okay, so why don't you repeat it back to me so I just understand that you guys know so I'm not if I'm not in that conversation that I'm a hundred percent sure it's gonna get done right this time because I thought it was gonna get done right last time So this is a total surprise to me players earn points points are associated with between the player the game and the token and it's tracked at the time in which it gets earned and then all the reconciliation is done at the end of the day right yep and and and why and is it possible for me to earn more than against multiple tokens at once the points not if the association is explicit to the only the three right no it is possible for me to earn against most multiple tokens at the same time as long as one game has already been associated when you're playing right yeah you're never earning points for something that wasn't associated yet so this is very simple design it's like there's not really anything complicated about it you're just earning for whatever was associated because it wouldn't make sense for the player if you're earning points against some token that didn't even exist when you were playing. How would they even know or expect to have ever had points against this token? They never even saw it in the UI. That would be weird, too. So the thing that solves for all the user concerns and the engineering concerns is really simple. You're earning points against the balance for the game-token pair as you're playing for what's associated with it at the time you're playing it's really simple and if you came in from a link that was to one particular token then you're only earning for that token and this is to prevent all the drag alongs so that we don't get usdc drives 95 of the traffic but then 14 other stable coins receive all of this distribution for free all off the back of usdc that's why we implemented that and that's makes sense from the user perspective because if i tap earn us play and earn usdc in the wallet i'm not expecting to go earn usdt and a bunch of other stuff so it just may make sense yeah everything else is just gravy well you're not even getting it you're not earning it because you came into usdc and we don't want you earning 14 tokens you don't you don't even know or care about um and and the the difference in these reward pools could be huge like it could be that you're actually earning real money on usdc but then there's like some usde and coin that's got like a five dollar market cap and and it's just a total like spam coin in your wallet so we don't want it anyway so that's uh i um i don't want to re-adjudicate how it happened i don't care but like my point is like i just want to make sure there's zero chance that it doesn't get implemented properly this time, and I don't really know how it happened last time, but I don't think anyone changed the design, I think there's just a miscommunication, and that's it, because I think Damon was pretty clear on this. Okay, well, yeah, I'll make sure that it gets implemented the way it should, now that I've been brought into the loop on how it's actually been implemented. Do you guys think there are any problems with that implementation? No. Yeah, I, well, I wanted to bring up, I don't know if this affects it, but the reason why this happened. so i don't know if this affects this now but with the original spec it was because
[266.2s - 305.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: if a player when a game is registered a token is associated game goes out token trump token cool i'm playing i get i get trump later on that day somebody votes for you know some random game and it gets us getting votes for that with another token, and it associates it.
[306.7s - 307.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: Does that pool
[307.6s - 309.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: now, do those people who came in
[309.6s - 311.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: later get
[311.0s - 313.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: the rewards for that day
[313.5s - 315.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: for Trump? Well, that's
[315.5s - 317.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: not a problem in what we just described.
[317.7s - 319.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: This is the reason that somebody thought
[319.5s - 321.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: through something incorrectly and made bad design changes.
[322.2s - 323.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So, like, that's not a problem
[323.7s - 369.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: in what we described. If you earn points for Trump trump you get a shot at the trump reward pool if someone attaches a new coin to the same game called like trump it's a separate later right it's a separate pool with separate rewards every every single token has separate rewards and now if you play the game later in the day somebody else and you earn trump trump points and at all, Mark. No, no, no, no, no. That's what was missing from the whole how this started. I think that... Nothing was missing. He misunderstood. All of this was solved for in the original design. All of it. I haven't changed anything. Nothing is missing. It was just implemented incorrectly. That's all. We haven't changed a single thing about how this works.
[371.8s - 372.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: It's just important to me that we note that, not for my own ego,
[374.7s - 375.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: but just because to be clear about where things broke and why.
[377.3s - 377.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Like, if I made a mistake here, I just admit it.
[377.7s - 377.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I don't care.
[379.2s - 379.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: You guys know I change my mind all the time.
[382.8s - 382.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And I'll tell you when I change my mind and why and debate it or whatever.
[506.5s - 506.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: But, like, in this case, what we're implementing, what I'm asking him to implement is exactly what we talked about a month ago it was just done incorrectly yes so i don't want him to like suggest the design change thing because it's just annoying like if we're going to get better at not because of ego reasons but because if we're going to get better at production and like we're going to do it by acknowledging where the the problem happened and then making sure it doesn't happen again it's not it's not about blame it's about like getting better at production process we're not getting better at production process if we think that this is a design change when it wasn't so my my point here is in that situation mark just to be really clear they're they're separate award pools the people who played the game before the the whatever uh the trump coin was attached obviously they never earned points against the trump coin because it wasn't attached at the time they earned the points because that's the way we described it is that there's a there's a pair of game points um game token where points fields are stored and they would have played it before that other token was ever attached now if someone attaches that other token and then later in the day other people earn and they're playing and they're earning both at the same time because they came directly to the game and not specifically to trump well then they're earning for both and they're participating in both um prize pools but there's nothing unfair about that because their points are still being compared against the specific points for each token within each reward pool so they're not having any advantage whatsoever from being in that position the only difference is they're also earning the the trump coin which may be worth very little um and if they came from a play to earn button on on trump then they're still just only earning trump coin anyway even if trump coin was attached after the fact because the because of the attribution we talked about so that the trump coin can't just be some random shit coin that gets to to ride on the coattails of the trump coin anyway unless someone goes directly to the game in which case they can go earn all the coins associated with it but that'll probably end up being in the long run like a minority of traffic, right? So maybe in the beginning it matters and it's significant.
[510.3s - 510.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: But later, once we get all these integrations done, it'll be less and less and less and less.
[514.7s - 515.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Most of the traffic will have been sourced from token-specific places.
[522.2s - 588.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And the amount of traffic that Trumpcoin is going to source is going to be 99.9% of the traffic compared to some other random shitcoins that have similar names. So, yeah, that's how it works. That's what we will build. Yeah, and this is all what the user would expect. None of this requires anything from the user to... The sort of touchstone here is, like, the user sees the coins, the points for the coins that are there at the the time they're earning and they wouldn't expect to be earning more than what was there at the time They were there and they wouldn't expect to be earning less. It's like they're just getting what they see So this is all very self-explanatory for the user Yeah, yeah, it's it should be obvious just based on the path that you took i came in through this coin i played i'm getting that coin yes exactly it's all very straightforward so all these rules are only complex on the engineering side that we're hiding the complexity from the user the user is getting a pretty obvious experience with this that's why i think this is the right way to do it um anyway what else what else on the engineering side is there to go through today again all right so Breeze running to some
[586.0s - 590.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: okay here we go So Breeze was, oh, where is that?
[766.2s - 945.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Ah, there we go. Sorry. He was hoping to finish all the bonding curve stuff last night. However, he ran into what he thinks is a serious issue. Which is, as you know, when you make that first purchase or that last purchase, particularly in the last purchase, which is, as you know, like when you make that first purchase or that last purchase, particularly in the last purchase, like you have to know the exact amount that you are buying. So because if you try to oversell, then it doesn't trigger. But and if you undersell, the user buys thinking that they've graduated when in reality nothing has happened but the his problem is that the API that Meteora gave him does not give the precision that Breeze needs in order to make that confident calculation so he's pushed back what pushback is not the word but he gave the feedback to to Meteora and they're going to to fix that but he doesn't know how long it'll take them to do that well so so the this the root cause of this i because i think i'm in the chat is is related to the fact that we're using the all these random coins to launch these as a quote token right is it not um i don't know i'm not in the meteora. Well, so the thing that you'd ask is there were six customers in production with the dynamic bonding curve a few weeks ago. So clearly, like, this works. So it's a problem for us. And the question would be why is this a problem for us and not a problem for other people? We never actually graduated them. Like, we had to graduate them by hand. No, no, no. I don't mean that we – no, no, no. I don't mean it's in production with us. I mean it's in production with six other customers who are trading these coins. So it obviously works. So the question then becomes, why doesn't it work with our implementation? Yes, because that might be another path to solving this problem or understanding the problem better. And if we can't answer that question, the answer is not, hey hey their dynamic bonding curve doesn't work because it obviously does believe is literally using it with all these coins they just launched they're using the dbc the same thing we're using so clearly it works um why doesn't it work for us like if that's the first question that has to be answered very clearly um i think and i i'm talking about just seeing push notifications go through on my phone that it has to do with the fact that we're using these other tokens as quote tokens instead of soul yes i think that's what it is but i i think you should confirm that um and then if if that's the case then one potential solution instead of like just waiting for them would just be to use soul um the side effect of that would be that the original um bonding curve would not have been started with the original token and we said we liked that idea because it would put buying pressure on the original token but it also puts selling pressure on the original token too so it's kind of a mixed thing because if a bunch of trump holders come in and they they use their trump to buy g trump they're actually selling trump to get g trump yeah um so that's putting selling pressure on on trump actually which could literally make the price of trump go down not not up um if if new buyers get excited about um about g trump and the only way that they can get g trump is to go buy trump well then now you're adding buy pressure to trump which then some of which turns into sell pressure but it kind of nets out to be it just yeah maybe it just kind of like nets it just technically speaking if they took all their trump and bought it into g trump then it's just kind of a wash but what happened was that you created a bunch of volume for them and they earn fees on that so they like that trump himself is earning fees on the trading of the trump token and the liquidity pools so they're not mad but in any case like it doesn't really clearly benefit them that much and then later as you know you know we're having two liquidity pools one with the Trump pair and one with the OG G Trump pair. So we're not even following this model later. This is only a little bit of a bonding curve thing. So what that means is this can be very easily avoided by just saying, let's go with sole G Trump. And then you have no issue. And then you avoid this whole problem because if we don't think that other part is very important to our design then we're good and one of the reasons we added it was we said it'll feel less like a derivative if you're having to buy it in the currency of the base token but but one of the changes we've proposed since then is is that the only people who should be able to launch these tokens are the the dev wallet or a top three to five wallet, which would give you kind of like even stronger provenance than than that. Because the bonding curve is like. It's it's going to play a very small role in these larger tokens. It'll be cleared quite, quite quickly. So, I mean, last I heard, like a lot of the belief bonding curves were graduating in like six seconds or something. Right. So it's not exactly like a place where these things are spending a lot of time trading. And then our model is that like with the trading pairs later, we're literally not even requiring that they, they have Trump to buy G Trump. So, so it's just, it's not even something we hold onto as a requirement a requirement so my my sense would be that we've already this this part of the design is probably unnecessary and may even cause huge problems because beyond this issue um it could cause another a number of other problems with just trading bots in general because it'll take two swaps for people to buy any of this stuff instead of one um and that just makes every trade more complicated
[945.2s - 941.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: for people to ape in on this stuff so in a world where we where we go with soul which which i have no problem with um do we reward players with soul or do we spend money to buy trump and reward them with it
[941.0s - 946.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: well we're going to be in that
[946.0s - 947.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: position anyway right
[947.3s - 950.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: yes because once
[950.1s - 1045.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: it graduates we have to take og and swap for for trump anyway so we're already doing that as my point like it's just the bonding curve that's not so with with the dynamic bonding curve i believe you can take all the fees in the quote token yeah, it would be convenient to not have to swap. But I don't think it's necessary. Oh, yeah. Necessary is not. I just wanted to make sure that... Right. Yeah. Rewards are definitely in Trump, not in Solana. So, yes, we have to swap. That is the trade here. This means fees are whatever lower from the swap. i'm assuming a sole trump swap is cheap it's highly highly liquid swap right sole is the base pair for everything so for most things so so it'd be very easy to swap that's true it'd be extremely cheap so yeah that's my um my take on this is like the solution to this is probably just getting rid of that concept because i'm not sure it adds anything in fact it could even create some small amount of cell pressure um but it doesn't it's it's probably net it's net cell pressure right ian because most people wouldn't be new buyers would be trump the reason why i say it's
[1045.3s - 1051.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: it's probably net positive is because i i mean i assume and i guess that's just based on my
[1051.2s - 1056.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: behavior and the people i know is that they buy a hundred of trump and they they they leave like
[1056.6s - 1062.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: five or ten or twenty in their wallet and they send the rest to to to wherever they want to send
[1062.7s - 1069.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: it and that's why eventually trump like keeps a little bit of it yeah but trump is a specific
[1126.1s - 1226.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Thank you. to wherever they want to send it and that's why eventually Trump keeps a little bit of it yeah but Trump is a specific example but there's 800,000 holders already so there's not a lot of new buyers coming in for Trump they're just going to be spending their Trump and so all that is just sell pressure not buy pressure and by the way all this is happening on the bonding curve so most of these people won't be trading that way anyway. It's going to be over in a moment, and then everyone's moving to the DAMM V2, the liquidity levels. Look, I think the simple answer here, if you guys agree, is just get rid of this concept. I think the reason that we thought it was helpful is it created a real clear tie between the base token and the game token. But now we're talking about launching in a way where the only people who can launch the tokens are the dev wallet of the token or the top holders of the token which creates a very strong link that's much stronger than this link actually um in terms of provenance because like if some random dude goes and launches you know g giga that has nothing to do with provenance actually like just the fact that it's tied to giga in the on the trading pair has nothing to do with this coming from people involved with the giga community but actually like having making sure that's only a top three wallet or or the dev wallet of gigas is clearly like semi-official Great, I'm happy to switch to Solana. I'm sure it'll make a bunch of things a lot easier. So I will work with the engineers to do that and I'll let architect know as well. But anyway, so Breeze worked on this and eventually decided to put it on hold and he started working on the V2 integrations but he spent way too much time arguing with Meteora so he didn't get to finish these yesterday but his ETA was for tomorrow so So I guess he's still in on time i think one of the things he spent a lot of time arguing with them about was actually about um minting yeah right well yeah no one likes it right because it gets flagged as as a rug on all the screeners yeah so that's the the problem as they were saying to us they weren't like they're like hey if you do that then everyone is going to see like a red big red x on your token everywhere um so they're they're really hesitant to to do it so i need to come up with another mechanism to keep the reward pool fed, if we're not going to be minting.
[1228.8s - 1242.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: A solution that we discussed was to use the Bitcoin approach and do halvings so that the rewards, after a certain time, get halved, and after that, they get halved, and after that, they get halved.
[1242.7s - 1245.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: So it will never be forever but it will certainly
[1245.3s - 1326.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: last a long time. And assuming the price of the token grows then that halving shouldn't affect it as much as otherwise. Yeah I mean it works with Bitcoin in part because the inputs have have real costs uh energy has a real cost and then it forces um that keeps a baseline on the the price because uh the the miners are they're effectively buying into bitcoin at a certain fixed cost and so they they're unwilling to sell below that cost so it creates like a floor on the the bitcoin price so in our case like that's not really the case so it's it's kind of interesting um but but i'm not i mean the trading fees still allow for rewards so it could be that even a linear distribution of the reward pool ends up growing in the amount of rewards people receive over time anyway if the token continued to get bigger and volume continued to increase. What would happen is that there'd be a sudden drop in rewards rather than a smooth paper once the two years was over. Isn't then a question of making the halving iterations shorter? No, no. I mean, I'm just saying ignoring the halving for a second because i think the dynamics are quite different on this token than bitcoin so like it's it's a useful way of looking at it but it's there's also a lot of reasons that it's it's not similar so so like i i don't um i guess what i'm saying is like the The, you could, there's a couple things we can do here.
[1326.0s - 1385.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: You can make the reward pool bigger than it is you can extend the length of time that the reward pool rewards um and and you could draw drag out the length of the reward pool by making it non-linear that's the what you're talking about with having or could be any other formula it doesn't really matter but the rewards don't end when when the reward pool is exhausted anyway because we're already giving back the trading piece so what we're really talking about is just making it so there's not a sudden large drop um at some point in time that it instead
[1385.2s - 1387.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: tapers off gracefully.
[1388.2s - 1389.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: And that is a very solvable problem.
[1391.4s - 1392.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I'll find
[1392.1s - 1393.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: a curve that gets us that.
[1396.4s - 1397.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Cool.
[1397.7s - 1399.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it doesn't even need to be a halting.
[1399.8s - 1401.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: It could just be literally like a
[1401.6s - 1403.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: curve. Yeah, like a haircut every day.
[1404.6s - 1404.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[1407.5s - 1408.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Let's
[1408.1s - 1409.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: just look at other projects if we do that
[1426.0s - 1465.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Thank you. could just be literally like a yeah like a haircut every day yeah um that's and let's just look at other projects if we do that because i'm sure we're not this is definitely something that's been done before okay so like this is this is a typical like reward schedule and curve is definitely not we're not the first people to tackle this so i don't want to do anything crazy um i'm guessing there's just some some function that you run over time and instead of it being linear it's like it's a shape of a curve that we like that's it that's that's it um and then ian one question i had for you because i was looking at some of these other token launches just wanted to get your your take on this like there there are a number of them where like we have this 45 public sale part still and we were kind of worried about like insider versus outsider allocation or something like that um but but then if you look at like a number of these other ones that have been kind of working
[1465.3s - 1765.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: yeah they're not really less following this rule at all it seems like people don't care that much yeah yeah i i i i've thought of that like last week when you showed i forget which one that was like selling like 20 of the volume on a on a curve it's like well i guess that that barrier is no more and well i think it applies to like uh tges on exchanges because people want to know that there's not too many insiders when you're doing this giant tge but it seems like on fair launches people have like a lot more flexibility because the trump coin was 20 public sale um and then a lot of these other launch pads seem to be like so the git fish one is one-third one-third one-third it's one-third public sale um one-third goes to the repo owner i i think and then i don't know what the other one-third is maybe liquidity and other stuff something like that um the ego one i sent is fifty percent of the token supply goes to the social um profile account owner but it's it's uh vesting and it's it's um earned by them hitting milestones which they haven't released yet but the milestones are basically that they hit certain market caps um so it's like you hit a million dollars market cap you unlock another five percent you hit 10 million unlock another 5%. But there's 50% allocated to this person. Now, the nice thing about allocating them against market caps is, like, the sell pressure comes as the price goes up. So it can be absorbed. So it aligns traders and the creator in that way. But the question for us more concretely is, like, we were talking about, hey, where are we going to get these points from and one i think that it stands to reason that we could probably make the reward pool larger than 25 that's the first point yeah two it's also possible that we can make the airdrop pool larger and when i was thinking about like if we're going to go to this mode where we want to get really permissionless we're having all these convos with people about launching tokens related to giga chat and all this stuff and all that's become apparent to me is like there's way too much heavy lifting for us to run 100 of these at once that there's no way for us to like properly capitalize on this without the chaos and so the question is like how do you how do you run the maximum amount of these and have them go go as well as possible because their tokenomics are as aligned as possible no matter what random thing happens so my take on this now is like one thing that you could do is you'd increase the airdrop allocation like you would double it probably to from 10% to like 20% so you're really just saying like the original community is going to own a lot of this token you're going to get more goodwill from them than 10%. That's number one. So I'm curious to get your take on that. Definitely the bigger a stake you give to the base coin holders, the more incentive you get from them to be invested in its success. I feel comfortable now about um about selling less on the curve and giving more for rewards because all people already have proved that it's that it's possible yeah so that's number one and then the question would be do you also then um and well so that well the side effects of this are that then when people look at it on certain screeners and stuff what they see is that a bunch of the supplied fdv is quite different from the market cap because a bunch of the supply is locked up or in these airdrops and these reward pools and stuff so it doesn't look when a trader looks at a meme coin they love it because all the distribution the market cap and fdv are basically the same because all the stuff is out there and there's no surprises about unlocks and stuff like that they don't need to do the research they can just look at the chart and the chart is the chart and the holders are the holders and there's no vc unlock coming in three months or whatever and additional research you have to do so in our case like the side effect of of doing larger and larger reward pools and airdrop claims is that basically like the float or the amount of public sale supply is like smaller and then when people look at it they're like what's all this stuff going to and they just don't feel like going and researching it um if people understand this as an asset class then it seems not to matter because then they're like oh this is the same every time it's another g token like 20 is going to the airdrop yeah you know some of it's going to the game rewards that's all happening at the protocol level there's not going to be any shenanigans there and then like they can get comfortable with it pretty quickly once they understand what it is but the first time they see it they might be like wait a second where's all the where's all the supply right so that's the drawback um yeah i don't know the thing that comes to mind is like whether we do 25 or 35 game rewards it's like kind of arbitrary but going from 10 to 20 airdrop feels pretty pretty like it has a pretty significant benefit to me i think because like, because it really gets them enough of the supply where they get behind it organically, which is, I think, what we need. Because what I'm seeing is that if we rely on the Herculean efforts of one person or three people to go and get each community organized, then it's probably not going to work. there needs to be like enough of a groundswell
[1765.1s - 2009.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: of holders that think this is a good idea that it just kind of happens not to say there shouldn't be some leader who like goes and tweets about it and stuff but but if we're relying only on a leader then then we're probably not in a good situation because like that's not how most of these tokens work most of these tokens most of these meme coins are just they're they're mobs of people and there's there's often not a clear leader so yeah my my thinking lately like the last week has been to up the airdrop supply from 10 to 20 i wanted to get your take on that yeah um i can support that i like it mark any reaction i don't know what else that affects for the airdrop supply it means that the public sale would be smaller what percentage is public it lessen? Not trading volume. The trading volume is not smaller. The amount of people trade the token is the same. The amount of supply that's available for people to buy is smaller. Right. Yeah, so it's 45% right now, and it would go to 35%. That's huge. It seems like that's big. Yeah, it's a trade-off. Yeah. No, is it worth the trade-off i meant 35 is still big like i don't think people really it's big it's big depends on what you compare it to so like the meme coins like there's nothing held back for a lot of them right so that's the thing so people like trading them because it's it's easy because you don't need to worry about what supply is going where or when. But we can't do that anyway. For us, it's really just a question of like, is it 50% or 35% that we trade? We still need to have reward pools and stuff. I think it's safe to go down to 35%. And, but yeah, I don't think we need to, I mean, I don't think it's necessary to increase the reward pool, particularly if we implement the solution we were discussing earlier where things taper off, and also because we presumably have confidence in the model and we expect that the value of the token itself will rise so smaller and smaller rewards will still mean you know the same or more usd okay then let's do it i mean let's do do you think that uh that that people will see a material difference in the 10% air drive versus 20%? Like, or is it, are we just giving away more free stuff without additional appreciation by people? So from, from their perspective, they don't know that we went up from 10 for, for them. It's just going to be 20. And I think, I think to, you know, I think it sends a very, very strong signal signal like just saying like one fifth is just sounds really strong yeah especially when you consider 20 is going to liquidity and then 25 is going to game rewards it's like you're like like they're getting half the largest beneficiary yeah yeah technically they're half of the the trading supply at day one because we're not putting investing for them, are we? Oh, we did have the vesting thing where it has to hit certain market caps for their unlocks to happen faster, right? Yes. Yeah. So technically, their supply can get unlocked pretty quickly if the market cap goals get hit. And that's the thing we're doing which is they can they're in the best position to make the market cap go up
[2009.4s - 2013.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: fast because they're the original community so they can work together to make the market cap
[2013.4s - 2019.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: go up fast by promoting the token which will get them unlocked faster which they have extreme
[2019.4s - 2024.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: incentives to do because it's like the the meme coin trader guys are just pumping the token that
[2024.6s - 2029.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: they're going to want to be able to sell as soon as possible so they can get money out so they better
[2046.4s - 2047.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: We'll be right back. because it's like the the meme coin trader guys are just pumping the token that they're going to want to be able to sell as soon as possible so they can get money out so they better pump the thing with them so that they get their own lock out they don't want to wait yeah which i mean it's not great if it goes to like 100 million and all the unlocks happen and everybody dumps. That would be the problem.
[2051.6s - 2051.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: But we don't need to say that they get 100% unlocked.
[2055.1s - 2062.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: We could also just say they get, like, half or something like that and make sure they're holding a bag.
[2064.2s - 2066.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: What would be the last unlock?
[2067.6s - 2067.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Ian had a spec on this.
[2068.7s - 2068.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: We reviewed a couple weeks ago.
[2069.8s - 2070.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: I don't remember the exact numbers.
[2072.2s - 2073.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: No, I said like if you... Explain the whole the bag thing.
[2075.0s - 2076.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Ian already presented the spec on this.
[2076.8s - 2078.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So we just pull it up and look at it.
[2085.0s - 2125.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Rewards for base coin holders. Toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon toon you guys see that yep yeah so this is mark just to remind you this is just a um inspired off of the same way that loop did their unlock for the creator of the coin which is to say that they they had an airdrop that of the same way that Boop did their unlock for the creator of the coin,
[2190.8s - 2191.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: which is to say that they had an airdrop of the Boop coin that was unlocked to them based on the market cap of the coin they launched, which is just the same thing. So everybody has an unlock on the airdrop, not for anybody else, just the people who are claiming their free airdrop because they held the base token. Their unlock is gated. The time is gated based on the market cap to token hits. So the bigger the market cap gets, the faster they can claim and sell their airdrop, which means that, one, they're selling into buying pressure so that they'll wreck the charts less because they can only sell when the chart goes up to a certain number so that's the first reason to do this is like these people are going to sell either way when they get an airdrop there's going to be a huge amount of that just want to dump and they don't care about this thing but at least this way they will dump into a chart that's growing because the unlocks are based on hitting certain market caps so it means that instead of someone just flooring all of it and dumping everything, they'll instead be dumping it as the chart is going up.
[2193.2s - 2194.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So, like, there's going to be pressure pushing back against them.
[2197.4s - 2198.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: That's the reason this is a smart mechanism.
[2205.4s - 2211.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Two is, like, it basically incentivizes all these airdrop guys to go and try to make the game token successful because they have bags and they won't be able to get out unless they make it more successful and then if they make
[2211.0s - 2213.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: it really successful they won't want to get out because the chart's going up and now they're
[2213.9s - 2215.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: thinking maybe i should hold this thing
[2215.1s - 2229.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: great so i've i've codified it uh so 20 and i'm looking as we speak for
[2305.8s - 2308.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Thank you. great so I've I've codified it as a 20% and I'm looking as we speak for the master document here we go and take this now to 35, bring this up to 20. And then we got rid of the 1% for treasury, right? Yes. Yeah, we're getting rid of that, and then we actually make our, but we are putting back in fees. So we'll be able to make, we'll own some of these tokens because we're going to be making fees from the moment they go out so um it's fine like well i guess we'll be we'll be collecting soul fees on on the original trading pair now we'd be collecting the base token before so we wouldn't have owned any of the g token anyway but yeah we i guess we'll have to figure out with the old bond with the old damm you take fees in both tokens and with the new one you you can take it only in the quote token which i think is actually better but from a governance perspective it means we might not be involved unless we actually went and bought the tokens which i think is is fine. So 20% is reserved for protocol liquidity,
[2308.4s - 2310.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: 20% reserved for holders of the primitive token,
[2311.9s - 2315.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: 25% reserved by the protocol for rewards.
[2318.5s - 2320.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: And this is now 5.
[2321.3s - 2323.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_00: 5% distributed at graduation.
[2324.9s - 2365.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Oh, is that? 3.4 percent developers 1.6 percent players i'm gonna double check this math because that's not exactly the the split but i don't want to do math in front of an audience and pull out the calculator and all that stuff. Okay, and then token must meet market cap of $120,000 to graduate. The other thing that we had in terms of how this has evolved over time is, like, we do have voting, proper voting now, at the dynamic bonding curve step right we're not waiting for
[2365.4s - 2386.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: stuff to need voting are you asking if voting has been implemented yet it hasn't yeah i know that but i'm saying from a design perspective we we have voting we have voting happening from the moment that someone launches one of these now there's no distinction it's not a post-graduation only thing anymore. Correct. Everybody's voting since moment zero.
[2387.6s - 2387.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Right.
[2387.8s - 2726.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Okay. this the one thing that might be too rich on this ian is like this the the distribution at graduation it could end up being really huge right i mean it's cool get some people rich, but, like, I'm trying to think of how this one plays out with a token that just graduates in six seconds, like, believe, right? Then what? Then, like, what happens with this? It just gets kept in the pool because there were no players and there were no... Or I guess there will have been players because people could have added the player the games and the players before the token ever launched right right right so people can be playing for this from the way before there's ever a token and supposedly earning the rewards or and so the way that calculation works have you broke it down in a spec it's basically you're summing up all the points people have earned from all the days and all the developer traffic and votes over all the previous days because you can't just take the one day snapshot like we do once it's graduated and then the fees are already happening from the bonding curve every day so they're already getting paid how does this part how do you calculate how much the developer get is that just based on day where it graduates, or is it based on all the previous activity? It was based on the split between developers and players, but splitting without accounting for the stakers. No, I get that part, but I'm wondering, is it the day that it graduates, you're just taking that same daily calculation to figure out what the divide is amongst the developers and amongst the players or is it all the previous activity it's adding all the previous activity yeah i guess i really if that's not spec i doubt anybody would ever implement it like that so we should go and detail it i will do that but i agree that it makes more sense for sure to do it that way it's like you get credit for all the points you've earned over the months of playing if you were playing these games for months before the token release not just some random day when someone finally happened to hit the button but each day they're getting the trading fees on the bonding curve anyway, before this. Yeah, they always are. Okay. And then the other thing, Ian, to make something simpler, I wanted to get your thoughts on is we had this concept of the traffic cooling because you may remember this, but this idea, was worried that that a game developer wouldn't get enough utility around adding their game to open game protocol to a token that didn't have any trading yet because they there wouldn't be enough incentive for people to go and play those games um because this is a while ago before we had sorted out like the graduation thing we're just talking about where you get a like a drop of tokens a big drop when it graduates and it was also before we worked out the fact that we could do voting on the bonding curve which is something that we we said we couldn't do for some period we were saying that wasn't possible and so there wouldn't be rewards during that period you wait for all the rewards would be waiting for the graduation remember that yeah so so now that's not true because like basically if you add a game in any token no matter how small it is or even if the token doesn't even have a bonding curve yet there's always going to be a reason for people to go and play those games so because they could someone could launch the bonding curve coin at any moment and they could be farming points for a token launch that's just happening in the future correct so so i'm not sure that we need like the separate traffic counting stuff um i mean it's also it the the other reason it's just to to help you know alleviate the rich get richer problem um where newer um newer games have a hard time getting players because they'll never get sizable rewards and it just becomes a vicious cycle um i don't does the traffic sharing stuff actually do that because i think the way that it works is the more traffic you get the more traffic you get back so if you're a new game and you don't have a lot of traffic of your own it doesn't help you but if you're a new game and you do have traffic of your own it does make sure that you're not just like stuck on the bottom not getting rewards or votes or whatever it has some benefit there but then the problem we have with it is that it's not like versus like. So we now have two measures for sorting the games, which is like one is based on how much rewards people can get. And the other is based on traffic that has been shared. And so you have to come up with some way to shuffle them in a way that sort of just makes sense. But the user just wants the one with the most rewards. So if you just interleave them and you say, OK, show the one with the most rewards and then show the one that is owed the most traffic and then show the next one with the most rewards, that's not necessarily the best for the user. Because if they get a game that has very low rewards but a lot of traffic, they don't care about that. They just want to see the games that have all the most rewards sorted by most rewards, right? That's what we expect. the design complication i've i've had with it is just that
[2726.2s - 2728.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: like it creates that weird sort of like dual sorting system where one of them is about just rewarding the devs and the other one is just about rewarding the players and then putting them in the same feed it like creates a little bit of a just confusion like it's just not as straightforward what we're we're doing so so just for that reason back to point to boats
[2728.0s - 2748.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: driven forward what we're we're doing so so just for that reason back to uh point to boats driven
[2748.5s - 2754.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: i'm not saying that we don't track traffic that's not what i'm saying that obviously continues to
[2754.3s - 2759.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: be a thing we need to track dau and mau and to all these games and like i said specifically to
[2759.9s - 2764.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: the the game token relationships we need to track the amount of usdc traffic on a game versus the
[2764.9s - 2886.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: usdc traffic on the game so that we're not summing it all up in one big blob and ignoring where it came from. But what I'm saying is I don't think that the traffic sharing piece, the reason that I brought up the traffic sharing piece is I said, I'm seeing with the Vive coders that they all need traffic. And what I'm seeing on our site is we didn't have a solution for new coins or for pre-graduation for people to get traffic because we didn't have incentives because there was no way. We didn't have the thing where it graduates and people get rewarded, and we didn't have the fees going to games, but then you solve that because you put traffic as part of the qualifier for the rewards, and so these people will be rewarded and then on the the bonding curve graduation they get the the drop of the of the tokens so they'll be handsomely rewarded for for farming stuff before the bonding curve or during the bonding curve so it just feels very redundant to me at this point and then if we sorted these games to the bottom of the rewards pool it wouldn't make any difference anyway because they'd be at the bottom of the stack after all these other games and so my sense is like we should just cut it that's you know if i'm looking to cut like it's a big it's sort of a complex system on its own and i think it's going to be very low impact because it sits at the bottom of the stack compared to all this other stuff and so like i just want to make sure we're getting this other piece right and i don't think this adds anything anymore really um i don't know i mean i i your argument is sound i'm just thinking about it as as as a regular person like oh if i if was going to drop something of mine into this system, which one would make me feel better? As a developer, right? Not a player. Correct. Yeah, because it's always been for developers. So what would change here is, like, if you're a developer and you just drop your game in you're going to get free traffic you're just not going to
[2886.0s - 2887.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: get a lot of free traffic
[2887.0s - 2889.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: but if
[2889.8s - 2891.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: we told you you'd get more free traffic
[2891.9s - 2893.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: based on what you contribute then yeah you're going to feel
[2893.9s - 2895.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: better but
[2895.4s - 2898.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: any traffic that we
[2898.0s - 2900.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: give you that you wouldn't have otherwise gotten will be
[2900.0s - 2901.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: because we put your game in front of people when it
[2901.9s - 2903.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: wasn't the best game for rewards
[2903.5s - 2908.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: which would be a service
[2906.7s - 2908.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Thank you. because we put your game in front of people when it wasn't the best game for rewards. Which would be a disservice.
[2910.2s - 2911.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Which would be what?
[2911.3s - 2913.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: A disservice to players who...
[2913.7s - 2914.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Right.
[2914.3s - 2916.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And it undermines our ability to get people to buy
[2916.8s - 2919.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: and hold the game coins to get traffic to their game.
[2920.7s - 2923.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Because now they're giving this alternate path.
[2923.7s - 2925.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And we had the systems that we had to create
[2925.7s - 2928.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: to make it work properly were deceptively complex.
[2928.6s - 2929.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Because you remember I was talking to Damon
[2945.1s - 2986.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I don't overlap that much because we don't really care if people send a ton of traffic to these games as long as we have this this system around the civil side for making sure that they don't extract too many rewards if people send 100 000 bots but then we prevent 90 000 of them from claiming because they don't do the proper things then who cares you know no skin off our back but if the traffic if we have to track the traffic in a way that we actually feel like is legitimate, that's a really hard problem. Even Google still has click ad fraud. Like, you know, if a trillion-dollar, multi-trillion-dollar company hasn't figured it out, then, like, you know, this problem is almost impossible to solve. It's just, like, a spectrum of how much work you do to sort of, you know, improve it. So I think that this is a deceptively large task. I don't think it's small. I think it could end up being something that takes weeks or months deceptively large task i don't think it's small
[2986.3s - 2989.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: i think it could end up being something that takes weeks or months to get right and i don't
[2989.7s - 3028.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: think it adds much yeah i i you've you've swayed me i think you make a very good point All right, anything more on this because we still have to cover kai and then mark's update okay yeah ian just one more thing on that there's still a way for a game developer to get more traffic without spending money and it would basically be they go and they they go after games that aren't crowded yet so so are tokens. So they go make games about tokens, which is great,
[3028.4s - 3032.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: because that means that the market is going and filling in the need, right?
[3032.7s - 3035.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So I actually think it's better this way.
[3035.6s - 3038.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: We should just keep it simpler, it's less for us to build,
[3038.7s - 3042.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: and it probably results in better game distribution across the tokens.
[3043.7s - 3066.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Great. I'll make the change to the rewards document as well oh I still think that the rewards should be partially based on traffic for the game so they could still game it but it's still 20% I'm just talking about I don't think we need to create a separate traffic score that is used to distribute traffic separately.
[3066.3s - 3067.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Yes. Oh, yeah.
[3068.7s - 3072.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it can all just be driven by the other system.
[3072.8s - 3074.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And I still think it's useful to have a widget
[3074.7s - 3076.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: to pass traffic from game to game,
[3076.6s - 3077.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: even when people go directly.
[3078.2s - 3079.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: It's just going to be based on the rewards,
[3079.9s - 3081.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: not based on the traffic score.
[3081.1s - 3081.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: That's a separate feature.
[3082.9s - 3106.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Which is, as you say, it's what players will be will care about anyway or at least the overwhelming majority of them okay I'll make the note shall we talk about that's a huge scope cut that's like a month probably
[3106.1s - 3110.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah that does simplify things a lot
[3110.0s - 3121.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: i don't know who was gonna build it but they will be relieved
[3121.1s - 3366.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: um So, are we good on this? Hello? Yeah, we're good on this. Anything else you wanted to cover on the engineering side? Well, just what Carl's basically got all the things. Actually, I haven't heard from because he spent actually a big chunk of his day yesterday working with Kai, but he also added like a bunch of pages like Coming Soon, made all of these, you know, like the thing is I rearranged these, I rearranged these, so I'm not sure, like, I know these got done, but I don't remember if they, you know, which ones specifically were done today or the day before, but all of those are done. He also spent a fair bit of time working on just back-end stuff with Kai, like fixing... What is it? Ah, yes. We fix the search for for the for tokens so that it is now just going to be filtered to Solana he did it but he hasn't deployed it so that's why it's not visible always oh never mind you can answer my question yeah yeah we'll get ahead of that mark yeah because we were looking today I was looking yeah okay yeah he finished but he didn't get a chance to deploy it so he'll do that when he gets here tonight and Kai spent a fair bit of time with with the points stuff on the whole external partner stuff um but he did you know um he did begin his work on staking um for some of these parts um he didn't get too far but he can at least say that he has a couple of things that are already that are already you know you know, you said, you mentioned that he broke that down with you. So like, what did he do and what, what's left? Well, let's see. So he was able to successfully do a stake transaction, but it still needs to be, you know, as I said, just hooked into the backend. So he's got to do that, that second state. There was this weird blue, this weird bug that was getting sent to, that was getting sent when you, how would I say, yeah, when you were doing, when he was sending you this weird block hack instead of hash when you were doing a transaction for staking He started he's really close to finishing all the redis stuff He hooked up all the stuff like okay, how much you know, how much have you staked per token? And displaced you this is how much you have staked of the entire pool all that stuff It's hooked up but there's no data and in DevNet there's no staking pool so there's nothing to see there until that staking pools are there and we can hook that up he's been working on displaying and calculating we had to stop a little bit about the calculation of and of the rewards so he
[3366.2s - 3373.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: started to work on this and when we were talking about unstaking I had like
[3373.5s - 3380.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: basically I needed to like just to document because he didn't know that
[3380.6s - 3361.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: that when you press unstake you're automatically claiming the rewards that come along with them so I just need to make sure that the spec reflects that I don't know.
[3361.0s - 3362.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
[3362.0s - 3363.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
[3363.0s - 3364.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
[3364.0s - 3365.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
[3365.0s - 3366.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
[3366.0s - 3367.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
[3367.0s - 3368.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
[3368.0s - 3369.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
[3369.0s - 3370.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
[3370.0s - 3371.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
[3371.0s - 3372.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
[3372.0s - 3373.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
[3373.0s - 3374.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
[3374.0s - 3375.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
[3375.0s - 3376.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
[3376.0s - 3377.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
[3377.0s - 3378.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
[3378.0s - 3379.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
[3379.0s - 3380.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
[3380.0s - 3381.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
[3381.0s - 3382.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
[3382.0s - 3383.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
[3383.0s - 3384.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
[3384.0s - 3385.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. know that that when you press unstake you're automatically claiming the
[3385.0s - 3470.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: rewards that come along with them so I just need to make sure that the spec reflects that tonight. We're also expecting him again to spend a fair bit of time on the things that Mark needs. The goal was to whatever like time box it to today and when we last spoke he was feeling pretty confident that he would be able to do that and i will speak with him in two in four hours and see how he feels about it as he starts his day yeah so the the key outcome of that conversation too is determining whether or not there's a going to be a client update or not whether or not um it's client or server based on the discussions you guys just had so that'll get rolled over to kai and then he'll be able to determine whether or not this is a client or not um so he displayed the sdk and the points thing today um it is showing um the token wasn't showing but the points were resetting and that's what started this whole thing so that's that's where we're at with that he updated the documentation i did a quick image to edit it whatnot um it's it's better but we have to wait for this thing to be complete before it rolls out and test it.
[3472.7s - 3473.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: So, another night.
[3480.2s - 3481.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: Were you done eating?
[3481.7s - 3482.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: Yes.
[3482.8s - 3483.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: Oh, okay, cool.
[3483.8s - 3905.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So, two things. I have the Solana images things i can go over there if you want to go over the i have the solana images a few of them if you want to try to check these demos out and then i have to ask some questions um for the yeah let's go let's do it yeah cool all right yeah i'm looking for the thing right now here it is all right so different approach here i like this one but um i'm gonna just scroll through if anything jumps out let me know it's like you know right path a little different a little knee lock up here see it looks complete it looks really cool when it's on the phone like that what is what is this fighting game man so i was trying to do these things takes forever so i was trying to do a versus game and i had this whole thing where I wanted to use these as weapons, as candles. Isn't this cool? This one? Tell me this one when you play this game. Yeah, you play it. But I don't get who's fighting who. It's like Solana person fighting Solana person. Yeah, I was getting there. You have to do steps. If you try to like do a lot at once so i was trying to come up with something with a 1v1 like a not mortal combat but like you know maybe i would do what i was thinking like maybe i just slap like ethereum logo on someone and slot the other it doesn't need to make sense it just needs to be like cool looking like this but i wanted to get i tried so hard to get these in these guys hands and then change the background to make it crypto but i don't know so i ended up going down this path because these came out really cool i love these this one came out really good too yeah the cool thing about solana is they embrace the financialization whereas like ethereum kind of tries to like hide it it's all about culture or whatever but salon is like you know very upfront and center about hey this is about like trading assets it's all about financialization of of the world so i think this stuff will resonate with them this one i don't know it went crazy on this one it just it goes sideways sometimes you get some really wild shit it's funny but oh no the verses this one's kind of cool i was kind of hoping this came out better but i found a way to like go about this now a little bit quicker so you go to you go to pokey and you you find a cool like looking image and then you you break that down in gpt to get it to what you want, and then you run the set of stuff over it. So you're using, like, image to image, where you send an image of a game you like, and then have it, like, re-spin it. And I did that by accident, and it seems to work a little bit better. That's much better, yeah, than making a random game. And then the other thing that I, well, it doesn't matter, but, yeah, I'm learning different ways now, like, to revert, like, just, I never would have thought of doing that unless I was going through this exercise this one I really like this one's dope this looks like like here check it out growlato isn't that cool I think it's cool anyway so do you does any of these jump out as well something you can use for one of the three well i i think yeah i mean if you really want to imagine you get three slides to communicate or you know game concepts then like and you wanted to show um if you were just to describe the game with like two sentences or one sentence what is the game one sentence to describe what the game is and then like two screenshots it's like app store type thing right yeah like i think that's the right vibe yeah these will go to v2 make them look cool you know do the corners like we'll get it looking good for the slide i just want to know which one you want what path like you like to go down um i think this one's really cool i think the runner is like is is clear i think the getting the obstacles right is going to be a little bit trickier you usually jump and slide right so it's like well yeah it doesn't i mean are you you're you're i thought it's not clear to me in this screenshot what's good and what's bad and what i'm jumping on and what i'm sliding on it's just kind of like a bunch of random symbols so that would be the thing where like if they look at this for a little bit they're gonna be like hmm you know what i mean like i'm trying to get past that next level like i'm you know it's yeah we can have like i can't do some photoshop like like here like uh this is like blank almost like a blank template so it's like you know we can add stuff to it like we can add stuff in here i mean i think you could simplify it i guess is what i'm saying which is like it should be obvious like what what i'm jumping over and what i'm sliding under otherwise this just looks fake like everyone's used to seeing a bunch of ai stuff so they're like oh you prompted gpt and then it just feels too far off and like, the only thing that would take it to the next level is, beyond the visuals, like, have, um, if you could get it, and I know it's tougher, but, like, it may require you to Photoshop or prompting it more specifically to say, hey, the obstacle that you jump over is, is this, and the obstacle, you duck under red candles and you, you jump over whatever, you jump, you run on top of, it's like subway surf surfers but instead of running on the train you're running on something else and maybe if you give it really specific prompts you'll get something back that looks more close because when i look at this what i'm seeing is like vague box art and then it's just like it just makes us feel really far off from having obviously these games don't exist but it makes it feel like the game is very far off from even existing because like we haven't even it would be nice if the screenshot was plausible is my point this one's real but yeah i know what you're saying yeah i can try that the fighting one didn't the fighting one doesn't really resonate with me just because um the characters feel like don't besides the glasses the characters don't feel like solana to me they just feel like random cartoon what does a person feel like well i'm not saying that i i have a specific i'm just giving you the few do you think these feel like solana characters i i i think what is a solana character i'm but but do you think they look like a character you think of when you think of Solana? I just think the answer is no. So I'm not, I mean, it's just, Mark, unless you want to defend that, then tell me why. No, I just, I don't know. I wasn't. Don't challenge me. Just tell me why you think they represent Solana. It wasn't a fight. I am putting it back at you. You brought it up. I think it's. But no, no, no, I don't need to. If I'm correct, I'm correct. Do you think I'm correct or not? No, I don't think it's, I don brought it up i think it's but no no i don't need to though i think it's correct i'm correct i think you think i'm correct or not no i don't think it's i don't think i think it's like not a non-issue these are cartoon this is a video game like i'm not thinking like solana characters i don't know what that is i guess i just have higher standards than you look i got to go present this oh really level people yeah i'm going to present this as c-level people at solana i guess if i
[3905.6s - 3910.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: if i have to go present to the c-level people at solana i'm i'm saying i think it's got to be
[3910.4s - 3916.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: really good no i don't know what a solana character means that's what i'm asking because i can get it
[3916.5s - 3920.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: to get to that if you tell me what you mean like what's a solana character like more adult
[3920.5s - 3929.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: looking like less cartoony like more real i would say that it's that there is no answer to that the
[4028.0s - 4034.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I'll see you next time. adult looking like less cartoony like more real i would say that it's that there is no answer to that the what justin is saying is that that doesn't scream solana it's not saying that it screams not solana it doesn't whisper solana like look i'm sorry mark like i'm like the candle thing is interesting i'm just saying these characters could be from a saturday morning cartoon so like i'm my point is like the only thing we have to show in these screenshots and unfortunately like you know how these guys are they're all about branding the blockchain side so the bar is like pretty high to impress them they've they've seen ai they're not like they're not going to think like if we put something in front of them that looks like we gpt'd it in two seconds like you're going to get the reaction from somebody who's very familiar with that technology. So they're not going to be like, oh, man, wow, like, I can't believe you guys did that, right? So, yeah, to answer your question, what does a Solana character look like? I don't think that's obvious, but I don't think these characters are... So less cartoon-y. Okay. Or it. Yeah, okay. I'll just make sure to prompt something that stays away from this style, which I can do. Yeah, I guess it's like the whole color scheme is kind of... Oh, yeah, I know. I mean, I'm just running by to see, like, you know, do you like this kind of concept? I mean mean the only thing that looks like solana in this fighting game to me is the glasses i just put it that way that's the only thing okay but and the other screenshots there's like a bunch of stuff that i can see that's kind of like solana relevant so i i like i kind of like the idea of a fighting game um i just hadn't imagined that um the can it's kind of funny to like like hit each other with a candle so that idea is kind of funny but the
[4034.9s - 4041.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: characters are just the problem okay okay let's cut less cartooning i'll try more more bold and
[4041.7s - 4106.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: literal and then over here this this this these I'm going to keep working on the racing game. A racing game for one of them. I think it's a good idea. And a cyberpunk thing. Yeah, I think the racing game is... Yeah, racing, runner, and then... Yeah, what I would say, i don't think you need like a huge quantity i would think about it like the app store um screens right so like if you want to show two screens then then they should each be something uh different like these two is a good example right you've got like the cover and then you've got the gameplay that's that's a cool two screens to show but like, if we do a... Because what I imagine is just we end up doing three slides, right? That's just showing some example concepts. And we show two screens. Look, here's the cover. Here's the game. And then the one-liner on top that's like, it's such-and-such game meets such-and-such game. Drive through the thing and, you know, avoid the FUD while capturing the games, whatever, some one-liner like that.
[4107.1s - 4108.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And then the next game is another slide.
[4108.9s - 4115.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And then you can show, just like the App Store, you show two to three screens that are each different because they're showing different parts of the game.
[4116.9s - 4119.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Yeah, this one, GPT, went too wild, the one you have your mouse on.
[4119.5s - 4101.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Yeah, these things go, it goes, like, it takes, you get, just to get something that you prompted to re-prompt to get your idea. You know how this works. It's just, it's like, you're just sitting there forever. I'm sorry.
[4101.0s - 4102.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry.
[4102.0s - 4103.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry.
[4103.0s - 4104.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry.
[4104.0s - 4105.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry.
[4105.0s - 4106.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry.
[4106.0s - 4107.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry.
[4107.0s - 4108.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry.
[4108.0s - 4109.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry.
[4109.0s - 4110.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry.
[4110.0s - 4111.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry.
[4111.0s - 4112.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry.
[4112.0s - 4113.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry.
[4113.0s - 4114.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry.
[4114.0s - 4115.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry.
[4115.0s - 4116.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry.
[4116.0s - 4117.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry.
[4117.0s - 4118.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry.
[4118.0s - 4119.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry.
[4119.0s - 4120.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry.
[4120.0s - 4121.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: I'm sorry.
[4121.0s - 4122.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: I'm sorry.
[4122.0s - 4123.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: I'm sorry.
[4123.0s - 4124.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: I'm sorry.
[4124.0s - 4325.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. things go it goes it takes like it takes you get just to get something that you you prompted to reprompt to get your idea you know how this works it's just it's like you're just sitting there forever and then yeah this thing just went ham and went crazy but someone came out good like i like this is like the foundation and environment is what you want to start with and then you what you're i mean we don't have artists to do this but this is what you do you you put in all the stuff like this would just be like coins and obstacles because it's a you know it's a racer game i like this one better than the other racing game because it it looks more like a real mobile game oh yeah this looks real yeah yeah this looks more like a real mobile game and the the colors and everything else are way more solana and like yeah so it's just more obvious that this would be a solana game this one just kind of like works yeah because it's the most on brand and then the fighting game concept could be interesting but it's not on brand yet like with the colors and the characters and everything else um for the running game i think it's just the the obstacles are not they're too abstract like it doesn't doesn't feel real it feels like a but if you could figure out how to make it feel real and you don't need a lot right there's there's not that many obstacles in these games there's just a few so if you could just think of what they are you get it prompt it and photoshop it then you get there yeah you prompt the bare minimum and then you photoshop everything else just like that well you prompt the obstacles you photoshop them in too so it's all yeah it's all asset creation so my my point is like on this one i think if you get the right obstacles then then this concept will will work um i like the one that you you pulled up better i just think that the it doesn't the obstacles don't make sense yeah like if these were like i know what you're saying they need to be 3d they need to be stuff you go under or over yes that get rid of these i know what you're saying like it's like just keep i i get it i know what you're saying it's like all this shit like just randomly placed everywhere it's like what is it doing like the solana in the distance like these make sense this one makes sense but yeah 3d like i know what you're saying you need the thing that you slide under and the thing you jump over and then this could work yes i'll try to i think i know what to do to prompt it i'll figure i'm going to photoshop this out and then re-prompt this and then try to get a more better base and then try to get a couple 3d obstacles so this would be like a you know like a, like a sawhorse or whatever. I mean, whatever I come up with, that's what you slide under. Did you figure out what those circle things are about? Yeah, man, I went crazy looking for that. So, if you try to copy and paste it, right, so that's the first thing, copy and paste, go into Grock. It copies and pastes as a copyright, so that didn't work. So, I had to describe described the circle within a circle grott had no idea and then it told me to go to my profile on twitter and type at like type something to see if twitter automatically converts something to the circle it had something to do with like people use that to say that it's just like a like their work like there's some kind of synergy between the platforms like people put it in their profiles I couldn't get a definitive answer I don't know or don't think it's Solana specific I did look though but I couldn't find anything and it copies its copyright which is very annoying okay I just chatT said right away, so it says that the symbols used by Solana
[4325.8s - 4328.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: is a stylized representation of the Solana token.
[4329.0s - 4331.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: It means it's the native token of the Solana blockchain.
[4331.8s - 4332.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: That's their symbol for it.
[4333.7s - 4334.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: I'm going to go find my...
[4334.9s - 4338.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: The same way that the three-line thing is used for ETH,
[4338.3s - 4340.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: this is what is used for Sol,
[4340.2s - 4341.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: but probably a lot of people...
[4341.7s - 4342.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Maybe not everybody uses it,
[4342.8s - 4343.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: but this is what they push.
[4344.2s - 4345.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So, here.
[4345.8s - 4346.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So, like this...
[4346.1s - 4347.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: How do you know how they type it?
[4348.5s - 4349.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Well, they copy and paste it,
[4485.1s - 4626.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: Thank you. but probably a lot of people maybe not everybody uses it but this is what they push so here so like this type it and copy and paste it or whatever this is eth right this equals so so that's as simple as that oh they just made it like we're taking this okay all right yeah yeah just like just like each took the other thing right um so and then the meaning behind it is um energy solana's name refers to sunshine in spanish it looks like a sun it looks like a coin clean unique recognizable doesn't doesn't use dollar signs like the other ones yeah i mean sure okay so it means solana so you should be using this in a bunch of places this is really central yeah i was we were going to i was going to originally i swear to god dude i looked this up on grok and it like just threw it through all this weird shit at me i guess grok is bad no i just no grok's really good i'm i'm gonna find it this was one prompt man this is one prompt this is my prompt i'll share it with you no i believe there's a prompt how did you copy and paste the this is i just copied it off their bio i said what is this solana's using it dude what copy is that the grok was reading it as a fucking copy the grok's not very smart because oh my god i can't believe it's so stupid okay yeah i get it i actually put it on one of the walls but yeah yeah i get it oh that's photoshop well let me okay i just got the same response from grok did you just have a problem copying the face again it's fine no i copied the piece of them let me see what it says to me the same same answer same answer same answer look look just It's fine. Don't basing it. It's fine. No, I copied and basing it. Let me see what it says to me. The same answer, same answer, same answer. Look, look, just, it's fine. Don't worry about it. But let's use it. It seems like it's pretty central, right? It's in their bio, so it's not some obscure thing. It's central to what they do. So we should use them. The Chinese symbol used in means double circle bullseye. No, no look at my prompt i didn't know what does this mean i said what does it mean when solana is using it i believe you that if you just drop the when solana is using it you'll get a bunch of dumb answers you're on desktop right uh yeah okay so i'm on desktop so on the phone that's what it was i'm gonna try it again later i did on my phone you use the exact same prompt and you get an answer that you don't It doesn't matter so I'm on desktop, so on the phone, that's what it was. I'm going to try it again later. I did it on my phone. You use the exact same prompt, and you get an answer that you don't get the same. I'm just talking about the prompt. It didn't matter. I couldn't copy the circle. That's the whole problem. Oh, okay. Sure. Yeah, it's hard to describe it. All right, it's Tim Cook's fault. All right. Anyway. Yeah, exactly. Can I just talk through something? Yeah, sure. Take one minute of your guys' time, and then at the end you can you could tell me yes no you're right you're wrong okay okay okay so platforms that we're that we're working with so two and two in particular the reason why i need to ask these questions is because once i get a grip on this i can apply this to anything or anyone these are two different situations yeah they're the same okay so vibe code zone and grokade we'll start with vibe code zone vibe code zone they have a wallet connect they don't have a login they do not have a universal point system and they just simply list games through a submit form grokade has a login it kind of has points he can get in there there is a point thing he can put in and the same thing it just it just you have a submit form your list games just like us right so the way that and i mentioned this last night but it just has to make sense to me what i'm going to tell them and you tell me this is right i'm gonna say hey okay here's the deal you're going to set this up you're going to have a wallet. Your developer wallet is going to handle whatever your whole platform, whatever you want. The money goes to your developer wallet. Whatever you do with your money, we don't care. Yes? So far? Can I just step back for a second and just ask a bigger question? So does VibeCodeZone have an API that these developers are integrating at all? Okay, so that I don't know, but I know… That's the key question. I asked them this, and they're working on something, but I don't know the answer to VibeCodeZone. What does the Wallet Connect do on VibeCodeZone? It doesn't work. Watch, it's going to work for you. No, I mean, I see the button, but I don't know. Yeah, it doesn't work. I don't even understand what it's supposed to do. So I think you've got to do more fact-finding on what these things do. I mean, look, so here's the thing. What would be interesting? So they don't need to have a global-level point system. That's not really necessary it's just means they would get more
[4626.1s - 4665.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: games in if they've successfully um convinced some of these developers to integrate their apis because i know that i'm not sure if it's vibe code zone or one of the other ones we're looking at but some of them seem to have this thing where like if you go to these games and you play them even though you're playing them in a new tab directly on the developer's website um they they put their own little tags on there. Like, for instance, if you go to this game, this game has been kind of popular, this, like, fishing game in the ocean or whatever, I got there from the Vibe Code Zone website. But now I'm on their site. And if you look at the URL, there's no refer tags in here in here that says i came from vibe code zone right right
[4665.8s - 4660.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: so it's not like i'm coming in on a special url i'm just at their site but look at this thing in the water there's a big thing that says vibe code zone in the water right see that so like do they have an api like is how is this thing showing up here did they did they give the the developers
[4660.6s - 4662.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: put it in
[4662.8s - 4664.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: well maybe
[4664.9s - 4825.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: you're assuming that. But look, so my point is, like, when you click on it, it goes to VibeCodeZone. So the developers, do they have, like, is it just as simple as saying, hey, did the developer just put something in the game? And, like, when you click on it, then it goes to our site? Or is there more going on here here because um if they're doing more then they have the ability to convince these developers to do things whether they have an api or not is is sort of not really the point it's like the point is can they convince developers to integrate things the answer seems to be um seems to be yes and what is their submit process so it's uh so one of them is a google form and the other one is uh yeah and i'm looking at the google form but like do they force you to put a link back to vibe code zone probably right they're probably not giving everyone free traffic it probably seems like a requirement that you you add this vibe code zone thing in your game to send traffic back to their site right that seems to be what's going on so what i would say is like what you see these guys as is is game publishers basically and and if and we don't want to deal with all these developers directly so so so there's two ways to work with them one is like you said they could have a points system on their website that they operate that we then use where we like have people earn points on their website that are then they're getting credit in these games somehow but it seems like some of them are just doing this traffic sharing thing where they're just kind of linking back and forth to each other and if that's the case but they're still talking and working with all these devs because they worked with them to get to do the traffic sharing then they're in touch with all these people and what you really want them to do is go tell those people to integrate our protocol that's what you really want them to do that's how you get all these games inside on our website and then if they convince them to integrate it and they take some cut like that's cool then they get five percent or whatever maybe they add the game and then they can they get their five percent and they convince them to go integrate it directly yeah no that that's that's cool. Then they get 5% or whatever. Maybe they add the game and then they get their 5% and they convince them to go integrate it directly. Yeah, no, that's, I mean, that's like the big... And they don't have to write any code for their website. So the point is, like, who are these people? Maybe they're just publishers, right? Like if they have other aspirations, if they want to make a point system on their website, that's also fine but like i don't think we want
[4825.3s - 4829.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: to have them go build stuff that they don't want to build or that they're not already planning to
[4829.0s - 4833.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: build because then it it's just less likely we get anything done we don't really care i don't
[4833.5s - 4837.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: care if they they do some point system on their website we don't really benefit from that like
[4837.9s - 4841.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: all i care is if they get games in or not and if they're incentivized to get games in and they're
[4841.5s - 4845.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: like hey this is easy and it doesn't get in the way of their business and they don't have to do
[4845.1s - 4849.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: any code that's great like why don't they just go tell all these people to put this thing in
[4925.9s - 4926.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: Thank you. If they're incentivized to get games in, and they're like, hey, this is easy, and it doesn't get in the way of their business, and they don't have to do any code, that's great. Like, why don't they just go tell all these people to put this thing in, and then they can take 5% of all the earnings for having, they put the game in, and then they instruct these developers to integrate. So without the integration? The game developers could end run around them, by the way. They could be like, no, and then they just add their own game, and then. Oh, sure. Yeah, they don't they don't own 100 stuff yeah so so unless they're doing it through their site then they don't have any way to really force the game developers to give them their cut because the game developer would be like thank you for telling me about this i'm just going to go and integrate myself and keep it all yeah yeah so but that's that's the only problem with this this plant so but it seems like that do you have an alternative yes we want people to get the og obviously but well the alternative to it is is that they um if the games are playable in their site which for both of them it feels like they're not they go to no i think one of them i think the link to the out of the site on vibe code zone is optional let me see well for grokkade and vibe code the ones i'm clicking on are all going to the directly to the gameplay the game's website so well they may be using refers but like i saw the that vibe code zone thing didodeZone thing when you went to phishing? Yeah, the big thing in the war.
[4927.5s - 4928.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: You saw it, too.
[4928.6s - 4931.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: The reason I ask is because even though it was a new tab for me,
[4931.5s - 4933.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: it could have referrer data that would make them put that in.
[4934.0s - 4935.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah, no, it's a huge thing in the middle of the order.
[4935.6s - 4938.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So you're seeing it even when I send you the URL without the referrer data?
[4938.9s - 4939.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[4940.7s - 4941.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[4944.5s - 5045.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: And then, like, what I'm seeing is that these guys are guys are like adding portals to the sides of their games yeah level started that correct so what we really want to leverage these guys to do is we don't want to do the sales outreach and if they're already doing all the sales outreach they have a way of making money by getting people to integrate our thing and then ideally if they want to make it more deeply embedded into their product to differentiate it and that's cool because they have the reason for them to do that would be that they get they're less likely to get um put out so how do we get these guys like they're they're saying like once we fix the bugs and whatnot they have a hundred you know they say a hundred things to go whatever what what's the setup to get these guys on now um it's it one, add all the games in your thing to the portal. Not portal, the protocol. Step two, convince these developers to integrate the API. And you earn 5%. They're literally going going to make money and they don't have to change anything about their website okay so that would be they're just sales people basically that's the minimum version yeah because that we that's what i'm going for right here is to get these just get them integrated and then they can go sell the guys on the the bigger version is like they build some version of this that's into their website that interfaces directly downward and then when they list it at all the games they're adding the url for the game on their site not the the direct url so the difference is like are they registering in the cave of a case of vibe code zone are they registering this url for vector tango where you
[5045.8s - 5053.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: can play the game inside their web page or are they registering this url for vector tango that's
[5053.3s - 5058.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: the question right that's the question so are they going to register the one that is their site where
[5058.5s - 5062.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: it's embedded are they going to register the one that's below and there can be games registered
[5062.0s - 5208.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: for both there's no problem there um they can own this vibe code zone one no problem like that's theirs and the developer can't get around them owning that as long as they're listed on their site they can they can take more there they can take 10 they can take 20 we allow that on their site it's five percent if they just go do the developer's url directly but it could be whatever they want if they want it to be through their own site yeah yeah so maybe they just go and register their own urls and then tell people and and then tell people to go integrate the api that's the easiest thing yeah do the vibe code so i'm like not the developer's website and you say hey you guys should go like do this and we all like eat yeah yeah i mean i don't know how many of these games are going to be relevant to zero of course but i couldn't find any well then yeah what but i mean you guys were barking up this tree before he was like oh we got to go talk to all these vibe coding guys so my question is like why think Zero Games are relevant? Well, no, I mean, I was hyping on something completely different. This was part of it, yeah, sure. But the way that this would work now if they're integrated is that they are a – there's nowhere – if these guys are going to promote their sites, it's just they're taking care of, like, marketing for us indirectly. It's not a lot. I wouldn't say marketing, I call it developer acquisition, is a huge, it's a more potent form of marketing. There's some people going to these websites, but it's not a ton. It's trailing off, I think. It's not that interesting. The only thing that's interesting about this is developer acquisition. These guys are going around finding people who are going developing games who don't care about just developing a game and not making a lot of money. They're exactly the type of people we want, and we'd rather not pay to do that. It's the expensive part of this. Relative to the hours of work we put in, developer acquisition is the hard part of this business right now. So we need to find ways to scale it so the reason i'm saying even if none of these games are relevant now the developers are super relevant in my mind um at least because they've kind of curated it right like we know that there were 1500 games that were submitted on the vibe code jam thing and then what i heard from the people on it is that like less than 50 of them were any good but these guys have gone and found the people who are good so like the the stuff that's in these directories is basically the people who actually
[5208.5s - 5213.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: matter in the vibe coding so why don't we just enter the ones that they have direct lines of
[5213.5s - 5218.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: contact to so it's like easy for them to go and suggest that these guys implement a thing to go
[5218.3s - 5223.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: make more money and get more users yeah so the the breakdown of that is like if they go do that
[5223.2s - 5386.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: where if they get a percentage of the earnings it it's very clear why they should do it. OK, so that's what you got to tell them, like, hey, if you register all the games, step one is register all the games on your site. It doesn't matter if, like, they don't attach them to a token yet. Just register them. And then and then maybe there will be tokens that are relevant once we think about it. Maybe they just get attached to some other stuff we didn't think of yet um oh yeah i'm sure there's yeah yeah i'm just saying in the imminent like first four tokens like maybe not but like there's gonna be they could be attached to anything i'm sure there's relevant stuff for all these if we looked hard enough yeah um so you'd say yeah we we get them all in there and then they can set a percentage that they take and then get all the devs to integrate it. That's it. Right. Okay. All right. I might have another question, but I'm looking at the other guys, but I'll ask tomorrow in our meeting. Yeah, we don't want them to create some weird meta point system on top of it. Oh, no, no, no, no. I was just listing their features, what they have. Yeah, that's fine. And if Grokkade wants to do it, we don't care. That's up to him. They want to do what? Points. I mean, if they want to implement their points system into ours, somehow that's fine. Yeah. But what we really want is access to these devs directly. Like, selfishly speaking, if these guys get them to integrate the protocol APIs, we're in a much better situation than if it's, like, all done through some weird layer on their site. We'd rather have as many devs using this thing as possible. Right. Because if they're blocking all the devs from having an interface with us, then we don't really have access to these devs. But if they get them to go and integrate the APIs, then all these devs are on board on our protocol, and they'll build their next game and think about us. Right. Yeah, they're invisible to us right now okay yeah so that works for both situations okay okay you know what you need to do there where like do you know what next steps are for these guys yeah i'm gonna tell them to get started on integrating adding their games to the protocol okay they can register them they don't have to tag them for now and it's in your best interest you know long term to start talking to the developers you guys have access to this way you all get to share the money rather than yeah we should just say that the step two is step one is get all the games in step two is tag all them they should go figure tags. Like, you should leverage the people we're working with.
[5387.0s - 5388.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Like, these guys want to make money.
[5388.6s - 5391.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So it's their job to figure out what tokens these are relevant to.
[5392.0s - 5392.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: Okay.
[5393.4s - 5394.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: Well, no, they have to when they register.
[5394.8s - 5395.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: They're going to have to tag them.
[5395.8s - 5395.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
[5397.0s - 5400.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: And then convince them and tell them, like, convince the...
[5400.0s - 5403.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: What would be, like, how would you, like, one-liner that to them?
[5404.8s - 5485.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: Point two. Conv convince them to integrate? What do you mean? They earn, they, if they want to earn money, then, like, they're going to have to get the developer to integrate properly. Because, like, if they just, well, if they just link to the game and it's not integrated, then we can do the daily reward thing. But I don't, I mean, why should I... There's no API or SDK going on. Because nothing's, I mean, the SDK... But that's what I'm saying. Get them to get the devs to integrate right without the integration you're not really getting money it's possible through the daily reward thing we've talked about it's nominal imperatively not necessarily um it it's not it's not nominal like if if you you could still get a lot of votes for a game right ian in the current reward system if you're not integrated you and you had a ton of votes it's still possible for you to earn just as much yes yeah so so it's not like implementing sdk allows you to earn more it just gives you control over how people earn on the player side which makes a lot of sense if you're a developer it's much better
[5485.0s - 5489.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: to be in a situation where you can really control what the players do because you now you're
[5489.3s - 5495.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: controlling their incentives right and who would get what cut it's up to them if it's on their site
[5498.3s - 5502.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: right and it's flipped if the developer integrates hold on
[5506.5s - 5507.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: yes it's two it's those two
[5507.1s - 5507.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: things
[5507.5s - 5512.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: okay
[5512.7s - 5514.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: that was
[5514.8s - 5515.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: the only
[5515.7s - 5516.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: question I
[5516.3s - 5516.8s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: had for
[5516.8s - 5517.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: that
[5517.1s - 5519.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: all right
[5519.1s - 5520.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: where is
[5520.0s - 5520.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: like Rosebud
[5520.7s - 5521.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_01: and the other
[5521.2s - 5521.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: AI stuff
[5521.9s - 5522.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: so I have a
[5522.6s - 5523.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: I have a
[5523.0s - 5523.4s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: meeting with
[5523.4s - 5523.7s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: them on
[5523.7s - 5524.2s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: Monday to
[5524.2s - 5524.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: get like
[5524.6s - 5525.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: caught up to
[5525.5s - 5525.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: like where
[5525.9s - 5526.5s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: exactly they're
[5526.5s - 5526.9s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: at and where
[5526.9s - 5527.3s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: they're stuck
[5527.3s - 5528.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: what they need
[5528.0s - 5528.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: there's some Thank you. like rosebud and the other ai stuff so i have a i have a meeting with them on monday to get like caught up to like where exactly they're at and where they're stuck what they need
[5528.0s - 5536.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: um there's some stuff kai was mentioning that's not available yet um we talked about the
[5536.0s - 5544.1s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: off situation and kai said that in order to he needs to talk to privy there's two things
[5544.1s - 5549.6s] Speaker SPEAKER_04: one was the claim widget which we talked about that was brought up he said that might be easier
[6026.9s - 6148.0s] Speaker SPEAKER_03: Thank you. in order to he needs to talk to privy there's two things one was the claim widget which we talked about that was brought up he said that might be easier he said he has to talk to privy to see if that they can pass from like uh you know person a to person b and he said they probably have a solution for that and then then we're fine if they don't it's he said it's easy to build a widget a claim widget which will allow them you to claim whatever is claimed on their website as opposed to clicking and then you know saying do you wish to connect and then you end up on our site wait so they want to do the claim widget for the devs on their site well this is the thing we were talking about for Exophase when I was mentioning claim on the site and then we were talking about how does that flow work passing the off token from an Exophase or a Rosebud to us through to say hey are you sure you want to connect your Rosebud account to OG? Yes. Uh, Kai said that he has to ask Privy if that's possible to pass that token from one to the other. Uh, I don't know that this has anything to do with Privy. Actually, I think Kai might be misunderstanding the requirements. Um, let me read it. I have have it written here we're not suggesting that uh that we use rosebud login as a privy login that's not what i'm suggesting okay uh he said we need to note note about claim from partner i believe the easier path would be to have your i'll just link it later but uh path would be to have a claim widget but we would need to make me we would need to take the following question in the privy if i have a valid access token from app a can i use it to log into privy on app b which uses the same privy log yeah that's not what we're asking to do oh okay that's not so he's saying that like hey can we make it so that different accounts can log you into the same privy account um i believe the answer on that is is is yes by the way i think we can attach all sorts of social logins to the same privy account. So that part is possible. But all we're really looking to do is associate which account is which is attached to which. So say that there is an account that was created for the wallet already associated with Rosebud at the time that somebody made the game. What we're really saying is that we need to connect them with an open game protocol um account so that we can then know which wallet also belongs to that that one and then if that's um it belongs to the creator of the game there's two ways to do that one is the way that kai is talking about which is like it all becomes one unified login with many different social accounts um which privy may or may not support and may i i mean then i i don't know but then the the other thing would be to just link them and to say that like yeah this is the ogp person from um these this ogp account over here and this rosebud account over here are the same person right and then okay yeah and. And then okay, and then you're done. And it's not like you can go log in with Rosebud on our website. It's just that we know that when you're using our website that you're that Rosebud person over there. Yeah, when you click the link, you pass the auth, and it's already known, so you're just in and you have your account on. Yeah, and these aren't the same thing, and they don't require the same parts from Privy. Like, there's nothing blocking us from doing a second one. That's just saying, passing along an off token and, like, acknowledging, oh, okay, these are the same. My opinion is that that would be the one we would want, and we don't want people claiming off-site. We want to keep people on our site as much as possible. No, no, no, no, incorrect. Really? Yeah, Mark. We're not a Web2 business. We don't care where they claim. Think about our business. Like, what we care about is max proliferation. All we care about, we make money on trading fees, period. Right. We don't make money on anything else. So if Uniswap said, hey, we want everybody swapping on our website, then Uniswap would be nowhere right now, right? Everybody's using Uniswap off of uniswap's website we don't care we don't want to care where people do it it's it's it is a true that our site is going to be the best place to do some of the stuff at launch and so it has to be good but in the long run or even in the near term we have zero preference we are not going to monetize most of the ui we're going to monetize through trading fees and the trading fees have nothing at all to do with where people are claiming so um i want the rule of thumb is it's not even like there's not even a debate on this it's like we want whatever maximizes proliferation that's what is always our north star so if it maximizes proliferation to have rewards be claimable on third-party sites then that's what we want like if rosebud if it's a deal breaker for some of these ai game creators where they're like no we don't want to send them to your site then we definitely do want to let them claim on their own site because the only way we maximize proliferation and liquidity is if we if we let them do it on their own site you see what'm saying? And so I've already had these conversations with these guys in like months ago. And that's definitely an issue for them. Like if some of them may be willing to ship in a form where the claims for the developers have to happen in our site, but none of them want this to be something that everyone's forced to our site, um, in over the long run. And what's, what's special about the incentives here is like, a web 2 company that's always the the um the arm wrestling match that there is which you just said which is like people are like oh shoot like who gets to own the users and what's really good about what we're doing if we keep building in this direction is that we're not getting in the way of them owning the user relationship but we're still the one making all the money that's better so we'd rather be in front it's faster for the it's easier for for somebody to make a transaction if the claim is on their site it's the opposite of what i said it's easier for the user to make a claim on their developer winnings on on rosebud site because they don't have to go to our random site and figure it out so should we build the widget we we do want to build the widget but the time the question is the timing for launch do we need the widget to launch if if rosebud is willing to do the other thing which is much faster to build and um and there will be some some websites like rosebud that that are more willing to do more development work to integrate us and they want to build their own claiming widget and there's going to be other ones who want to do less work and they just want to do the account creation they're like i don't care if the developer has to go to ogp's website to claim i just want my developers and me to be able to make money and do the little the least development work possible so both of those customers are going to exist so so like the the answer is um one is faster to build than the other um my sense was that like the claim widget on an external site would take more time than this account linking thing um but if that's not the case then like we could build that first but i i have doubts that that would be the case like i i don't think they said it twice that ui is complicated yeah and and like we have to make that ui happen in all these different sites they need a profile where they can view their wallet on every different site now you need to like have a whole embedded wallet rewards profile thing oh god i mean it could just be like an iframe or something right it's like it's it's not look it's not the end of the world there's ways to do this that are reasonable but the point is like the end answer is we have to do both the only thing we're asking right now is which one we do first okay hey guys i gotta meet with carlos in 10 minutes and i'd like to go to the bathroom before that you guys do you mind if I know go ahead Ian no problem they were good thanks talk to you guys later dieチョコレートチョコレートクリームチーズ駅の中央の駅は、駅の中央の駅は、駅の中央の駅は、駅の中央の駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅の中央駅は、駅の中央駅は、駅の中�チョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレートチョコレート
