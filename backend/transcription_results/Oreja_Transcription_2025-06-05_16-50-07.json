  "full_text": "Justin Waldron: Oh, my God. Justin Waldron: Okay. Justin Waldron: Yep. Justin Waldron: Huh, I thought it would have recognized me. Ian: What high-frequency noise? Ian: Everything's been going well. Ian: Huh. The fan? Ian: It worries me that you keep seeing high frequencies Ian: Hey Justin, how's it going? Justin Waldron: Good, yeah. Justin Waldron: what we need to do to make a transition here and then Justin Waldron: Yeah, I mean, I think it should be pretty, like, seamless overall. Justin Waldron: development we did with the outsourcers, which they're very professional and is Justin Waldron: to work with, so that's pretty straightforward to hand off. Justin Waldron: she'd get files on that soon. Justin Waldron: And then, Justin Waldron: and we had the domains. Ian: And then Ian: on the third party side Ian: I don't Ian: I think the big part Ian: a problem, and I'll take Ian: the Ian: blame for this. Ian: was, um, you know, when we started building this, uh, Ian: I don't know if you remember the earlier conversations, but basically I was â€“ Ian: pushing Mark Ian: into this role Ian: of being like Ian: game developer Ian: relations Ian: where when he pulled me at first, Ian: I was like, I'm not doing that. Ian: I don't know if you remember, Ian: but I think it was on the lead school. Ian: he basically said no Ian: and I tried Ian: to convince him Ian: that it was the best long-term role for him Ian: in part because I couldn't really see Ian: like other ways Ian: that he would be Ian: as impactful Ian: for what we were doing Ian: because I think Ian: his skill set Ian: really is in Ian: like the creative Ian: side of game Ian: production and Ian: design Ian: yes Ian: and Ian: Yeah, and so, but I think that, and I knew that it wasn't, Ian: and that hit what he was identifying which is that like he's not the person to go get off the phone and and Ian: spend time figuring out these things with these people was correct my hope was that the Ian: other half of the skill set would kind of develop over time, and then he got on board Ian: to at least try so I give him a lot of credit for that but then it became clear over time that he was just kind of Ian: like, I don't know, just avoiding that part of the job Ian: and not really excited about it. Ian: And so like things would just be left undone Ian: So I could coax them into sending a message to everybody, but that's not really. Ian: That's not really what we need. Ian: We need somebody that's actually spending time with all these devs. Ian: So it's going to be the hardest, so I guess in that sense, Ian: Like, I don't think we lost a game dev relations person because I don't think we ever really Ian: really had one true I think Mark since he sent a handful of messages when I when I Ian: of cornered him about it but he never really wanted to do that job or did it and so we Ian: haven't lost that role and then we sourced all you know myself and then Diego Ian: sourced all the game developers we have. Ian: So nothing's really changing there. Ian: but we do have to figure out some ways Ian: for that role eventually but I don't think we need it before lunch and I think it's going to be a Ian: tricky, tricky role to hire for because, you know, I, I've, Ian: looked around in the past and it's not as simple as like, oh, just Ian: fired game relations guy Ian: from like Pokey or something. Ian: You know, he's not going to be... Ian: Quite the right guy for this probably either Ian: so Ian: we'll we'll see um if you hire a crypto person then Ian: you're getting a bunch of maybe other debts you don't need on like, Ian: some other sides Ian: of the thing Ian: like Ian: I don't know Ian: it Ian: it's but I know we don't need which is we don't we definitely don't need at this Ian: stage or maybe maybe for the foreseeable future for where we're at we don't we don't need a Ian: like an executive type person, you know, we need, Ian: We need someone who can do the job. Ian: Yeah, someone on the ground. Ian: Yeah. So, so that's, that's kind of where my head's at. And yeah, I like Mark. So it's, Ian: it's it's not it's not great but it really it really wasn't a fit in the Ian: And then we spent a few months trying to make it a fit. Ian: could probably tell like we weren't really and we made some progress on getting some Ian: game job source Ian: but Ian: that's not Ian: really Ian: you could tell Ian: that he Ian: She was getting increasingly frustrated every day. Ian: Yeah. Ian: Yeah, we need somebody who wants to work with external devs. Ian: to let them do their job and you know Scott gets energized by getting on the phone with all these Ian: of random people on the internet. Ian: And he can't wait to tell me about the 20 calls he was on Ian: every day. And we need someone who's like that with game developers. Ian: and yeah Ian: fair enough Ian: Mark Flag Ian: for me Ian: the moment Ian: that I suggested Ian: that he wasn't Ian: that person, but I don't think we have a lot of other room Ian: for my learning is as we become more of like a protocol, Ian: We really need, I remember the first time I worked with Mark, he's like, Ian: You need to hire someone who's good at numbers because you guys are going to this Ian: realm of crypto where I can't really understand what you want to build. Ian: And that's when I, you know, Ian: Obviously, like, I thought maybe at some point when you were talking to me about how you Ian: guys work together. Ian: I was like, well, that could be what makes you guys very complimentary. Ian: But I think what actually ended up happening Ian: is that there's just not that much demand for like the pure creative side Ian: of things anyway with where we're headed and i don't and i don't think that we're actually going Ian: be on the first-party side of the development. I don't want to be doing any of that anymore. It's just a way to get our Ian: sort of marketing for the initial product launch going and then we're only as strong as our Ian: our game developer network. Ian: So like, if we built everything Ian: first-party games then we don't really have a network so we need we need these third-party Ian: to be like engaged in building content or we don't really have anything. Ian: So, yeah, my thinking here is like, Ian: It's... Ian: It's... Ian: It's a... Ian: Yeah. Ian: I mean, I should have, I think I, you made a lot of comments earlier on that Ian: But you probably also understood this dynamic and kind of pointed it out. Ian: Honestly, the good news is I don't, because it wasn't really a great Ian: that I don't think Ian: we're like Ian: set back by this Ian: in a really Ian: meaningful way Ian: at all. Ian: I don't think he was finding a way to be empowered Ian: unfortunately, and so the handoff should be Ian: a minor blip, but nothing too major. Ian: And then I think, you know, if and when, Ian: whether we find somebody who's more like just BD focused or more like hybrid Ian: product, sort of technical API BD focus. Ian: I know that that person has to be somebody, we need somebody who likes talking to Deb Ian: that's for sure Ian: and I think Ian: we've got a team Ian: on the engineering Ian: side of mostly introverts. So I don't think like any of our engineers are really excited about Ian: about becoming DevRel people. Ian: I don't know. Well, at least not Kai. He said the same thing, right? So... Ian: But when we work with the Meteora team, it seems like half their engineers are just happy Ian: come in and chat about whatever, so I don't know. Ian: there's a I suppose there's a difference between support and over message messages which Ian: most most engineer types are comfortable with and you know like outreach outreach Ian: and community building, which is a much more social enterprise, Ian: but we'll figure it out. Ian: Yeah, I'm sure it'll be okay. Ian: well we don't we don't have one but like that's the sort of role that comes Ian: up organically from you know from a community I think somebody that's super Ian: passionate about all these, you know, indie games, HTML files. Ian: games and also happens to be crypto and you just look at the token they love the Ian: idea and they start suggesting, hey, have you talked to this guy, have you talked to Ian: that guy, have you talked to this other guy, blah, blah, blah, blah. Ian: that line yeah i think you're right because we found the same thing happening with marketing Ian: We got this guy, Pedro, who originally came as an introduction for Meteora, and then he's Ian: from the sky Ian: he's not on the payroll Ian: and he's just been Ian: and Scott's gone through Ian: and kind of like Ian: close those conversations Ian: and taking them to the place Ian: where we're doing things Ian: with them but this guy's been so helpful um and and i just realized Ian: like because once he got like he believed in what we were doing he just he got really Ian: really excited about it and i i think that there's you're right there's going to be somebody like Ian: that for the game side and Ian: And probably if we went around trying to source them off of LinkedIn, we're just going to Ian: people who don't get what we're doing and spin our wheels. Ian: But the moment that we get this out and Ian: like, things start happening, there's going to be a couple people that, like, I Ian: That's a lot of what we grew â€“ when we grew Zynga, a lot of the original really core Ian: were people who were just really into building Flash games Ian: and already doing this stuff. Ian: We weren't convincing them. Ian: buying their companies, they were already building social games, they didn't need to Ian: be convinced right we were just kind of like picking the talent that was out there and Ian: then saying let's all do it together. Ian: And I think that's a really good recipe in the beginning. Ian: And I think one of the biggest challenges we've had is trying Ian: to convince a bunch of people who aren't believers into being believers when we just have to take Ian: That's kind of the biggest thing that we've done here that's been tricky, and I think Ian: the same on the engineering side. Ian: We'll probably find Ian: our best candidates too. Ian: So even more reason for us Ian: to just get out because I do think there's going to be a ton of people Ian: that are excited about this. Ian: and it is going to create like a magnet for some really good people that we could Ian: opportunistically pull in and I think you're right that like today there's some people I could ask that Ian: think are interesting you know board Elon Musk I think would seriously consider it if I if I asked Ian: But he is kind of involved with the Rosebud stuff. He did take the initiative to go make these games. He didn't work Ian: in games before he is in crypto he checks a lot of boxes but like Ian: I think there's a chance that we find people who are even better fit. Ian: You're right. Ian: I think I like that way of, Ian: thinking about it. I think we're really going to, I think we are going to find somebody once this is Ian: people start gravitating to what we're doing yeah and um question Ian: is how are they going to get a hold of us because we don't have a lot of social presence other Ian: But that's a question that's very solvable. Ian: Yeah, no, it's a good point, though. Ian: We have these channels, but there's all... Ian: like the spam and the scams keep getting worse. Ian: I actually had, I don't know if you remember him, Ian: because I thought he might have been on Cityville at some point. Ian: I don't know if you guys overlapped. Ian: I'm not sure, maybe he wasn't on City Public. Ian: His name is Anshul Dharawang, do you remember that guy? Ian: No, I don't think I meant that guy or I don't remember it. Ian: I had a really weird experience. Ian: with him yesterday. Ian: The reason I mentioned it Ian: is because he DM'd me Ian: and he was like, Ian: hey, what's going on? Ian: it was kind of weird and out of the blue and when he dm me he wanted to tell me about his project as a Ian: he didn't know who I was but I knew this guy I used to spend time with him in San Francisco occasionally back in the Ian: Zynga days. So I was like, what is going on here? I was like, oh, this guy's count as Ian: probably hacked. And it turns out he launched a coin, I believe, for like a six Ian: CityBuilder game that he bi-coded with 3.js and all this is real and then because he launched the coin two days Ian: ago somebody targeted his account and then it was promoted a fake version of Ian: of his point in DMs Ian: as if we had never met. Ian: So it kind of set off the list. Ian: alarms but this stuff is just everywhere now and then he was inviting me to connect with him on telegram Ian: and I was like, hey man, what's up? Ian: And then like, why don't we just, you know, Ian: I was just like, how are things going? Ian: I didn't care Ian: because I knew like on X Ian: nothing bad's going to happen Ian: but then he just kept insisting Ian: I connect to him on his telegram Ian: And I was like, oh, okay, this is definitely a scam. Ian: You know, like, he won't talk to me here because Ian: he like hacked the x account and he's trying to offer me to a telegram where he owns the account right and Ian: not, because he knows this X account may get taken back from him at any moment or whatever. Ian: that's what happened Ian: literally in the mid Ian: conversation it got Ian: taken back and he's Ian: just like dude I Ian: don't know what Ian: happened like my Ian: like, this is my real telegram. Ian: It's just so funny, like, you know, Ian: Once you have a token out, it's kind of crazy the stuff that happens. Ian: to these accounts and to these people. Ian: So yeah, I think that's the hardest part Ian: like how do you have open communication but also like not just Ian: just, I mean, 99% of what you get, it's just like literally the tax. It's, Ian: we'll figure that out I mean I think Ian: I think the Jupiter team has done a really good job on this. Ian: from what I could tell. Ian: I'm kind of Ian: amazed, Ian: actually. Ian: They've somehow built, like, Ian: a really very very strong community despite all this Ian: So anyway, onwards, yeah, I think for me and you, like, Ian: And Damon, when he's back, I just think the focus has to be, for all these reasons, I'm Ian: out and when I look back at all the iterations we've had on this I do feel Ian: like we've Ian: we had a lot Ian: of versions Ian: that I'm glad Ian: we didn't ship Ian: for legal reasons Ian: for product reasons Ian: but I do finally feel Ian: like we're landing on the one where like based on everything Ian: we're seeing from all the launches that have happened and stuff Ian: we've been able to learn from just seems really likely to work and now the concern is like trump and Ian: Elon are crashing the markets, and who the hell knows, as always, Ian: like where the volatility goes so i'm just uh i just think like Ian: it's like as we talked about the other day if we were to land in the top five then we're talking about Ian: $100,000 a day or so minimum opportunity cost every day we're not Ian: out. Ian: So I think we should just be prioritizing and behaving with that in mind. Ian: And now realizing that probably any of the decisions we're making at this point Ian: I think we're starting to get to diminishing returns. Ian: Like, I think we need to get the community launch mechanism Ian: to work around staking to get 5% to launch a coin. Ian: And then once we've sold for that, Ian: we've kind of solved for the most important thing which is like how to Ian: we launched one of these with extreme community alignment around making it grow and then how Ian: we have the basic points and reward system for all the games and then i think we're just ready to go you Ian: even if we don't love other things about what we're doing. Ian: Yeah, so to that end, my feedback there on the lockups Ian: was like basically trying to just simplify things so we can go faster. Ian: and realizing that we can always change it later. Ian: They change their lockup stuff. Ian: And we can change it because token launches will be happening all the time so we can just Ian: just simply change it if we want to experiment with it. But I'd like to see Ian: start with something simpler. Ian: If you're worried that people won't get enough fast enough on like a six month log schedule, Ian: I'm also open to just doing 30 days like they did with poop. Ian: Um, Ian: where it feels tangible enough for everybody to care, but far away enough that they're worried Ian: about not getting their money out. Ian: I think that's kind of the difficult balance here. Ian: It's like if they're not worried about getting their money out, then they're not motivated to go in. Ian: make the thing a success. Ian: I mean, I Ian: I think it's more about the initial lockup Ian: period than the length of the vesting period for me. Ian: And I just keep trying to think of, you know, what's that bound? Ian: of I'm getting enough to want to take the next step and you're basically kind of upselling Ian: them to support the token. Ian: Yeah, because I think vesting and unlock is a little complicated. Ian: It has benefits for sure because it means not all cell pressure all at once. Ian: Because all of these 20% of people would be on the same unlock accelerator. Ian: So we'd be talking about 20% of supply coming online at once. Ian: At some, I mean, even if a quarter of people sell, that's a lot of tokens. Ian: Yeah. Justin Waldron: Yeah. Ian: But that just, to me, is like, you just make sure that the Ian: the gates are higher. Ian: Yeah, I'm totally fine with going the boop route and just making a pass-fail Ian: kind of thing. Ian: So your concern is like too much supplies freeing up at once Ian: without the, versus boom. Ian: because yeah Boop was doing it for the Boop token of which people were getting a Ian: very small amount in the grand scheme of things like, uh, I don't know. Ian: And so, and everyone was on a different title. Ian: because they all launched it open at different times. So it wasn't like everybody Ian: So they didn't really have to worry about the vesting issue because everyone was on Justin Waldron: schedule? Yeah, ultimately, I do worry that if Justin Waldron: If we give everything at once, it'll work, but if it's working for boop, Justin Waldron: There's no reason to think it wouldn't work for us. Justin Waldron: The other thing I think about is if we're making... Justin Waldron: these goals high enough you know either it's either because Justin Waldron: Because people that know what they're doing and can make it succeed got involved. Justin Waldron: Too many low-value people, like, you know, mass market kind of thing. Ian: Right? Justin Waldron: Yeah, but I think what I... Ian: what I just realized from from when you when you ask it isn't because what we're if Ian: going to these this group and they'd all be unlocking at the same time whereas boom Ian: everybody was getting a boop claim yeah which they're getting a very Ian: Their own token, they were free to buy whatever supply they wanted. Ian: the claim was for the VOOP token, for which they had a very small claim relative to VOOP Ian: total supply. So what we're doing very differently here from the group is that we're, unlike Ian: lacking way Ian: too much Ian: supply at Ian: once Ian: so way Ian: differently Ian: like 100x, maybe more than 100x, maybe 500x more supplied all at once, and it's a modesty Ian: supply that can take the chart to zero very easily. Ian: Yeah. Ian: So I think that we probably Ian: have to have some mechanism to trickle it out, to your point. Ian: the weird thing is like how do you make a mechanism to make it trickle out but also make it super easy Ian: Vesting is a very tried and true method, everybody understands. Ian: time-based vesting. Ian: Is it just accelerating then? Ian: Like, A, you're vesting a Ian: over a year and then you accelerate a month, Ian: you accelerate a month, like what's the easiest, Ian: how do we show this in a UI where someone can look at it as simple as the chart Ian: I mean, the simplest thing is... Ian: basically to show that same time-based thing and then communicate or Ian: Put on a, on a, hmm. Ian: Or maybe just two tracks, you know? Ian: One track has the five segments, the other track just has the one. Ian: It's like a, you know, pick your own, like pick your path. Ian: You mean like two columns in the chart or how do you imagine that? Ian: I think of them as vertical lines, but columns also work because it would be mobile. Ian: So yeah, so what I'm just thinking is two lines, and it just says, Ian: There's like two roads to getting your supply. Ian: the short road which is just make it explode and the long road which is Ian: way over time. Ian: and then hitting a market cap does like accelerates the vesting or Ian: Yeah. Ian: Yeah. Justin Waldron: Yeah. Justin Waldron: Yeah. Ian: Yeah. Ian: I mean, maybe we can make it that it unlocks it rather than vest, you know? Ian: and it still has to it unlocks it but the time Ian: best thing still has to pass, you know what I mean? Ian: to lock in the best thing you're seeing, twofold. Ian: X market cap, or when this much time has passed, whichever one happens. Ian: And when you do that, Ian: that, you get this next month milestone. And if you reach the other, you know, if Ian: If you reach the second milestone in terms of market cap, you accelerate that second Ian: month. Ian: third month, that's a question, do we start the third month immediately? Ian: still doesn't solve the amount of supply coming online at the same Ian: Can we make it random? Ian: you know Ian: like every time it Ian: drops, people basically get like, you can start, you know, like, you Ian: You can start claiming at 10 p.m. GMT. Ian: claiming at noon. Ian: You can start claiming one day later. Ian: And every time it drops, it's randomly generated so that you have the chance to Ian: you know, to be early or to be late every time. Ian: Well, it might be enough to just make sure that it's, as you said, Ian: like trickling outs over time. Ian: linearly or something because and then you could offer maybe that's that's Ian: is happening all the time, so you're getting over it, right? Justin Waldron: Yeah. Ian: And if it goes totally vertical, then hopefully it can support the price action Ian: Although that is a vector, well, depends on the numbers, that is a vector for Ian: you know Ian: manipulation Ian: it's like Ian: if you have Ian: big enough Ian: bags Ian: right Ian: If we did do it as a percentage of market cap, like you're saying, it would be too easy to manage. Ian: I think it needs to be absolute Ian: because I think you need to make the dollars required Ian: to manipulate the charter. Ian: too high Ian: for people Ian: to be willing Ian: to do it Ian: like if you Ian: have to get to a hundred million market cap to to get the full unlock then we're basically Ian: not going to have Ian: to worry about Ian: manipulation Ian: it's too much Ian: money Ian: but if it's just Ian: multiples like you had kicked around the idea of and I think Ian: we would have huge problems because you can mark the chart to set yourself up to Ian: be able to do that very easily yeah yeah good point yeah I Ian: I think that's actually a very good compromise, just make it straight up. Ian: USD amounts. Ian: And then the argument for trickling it out over time is even though it's Ian: it's not as hard of a lock as what Boop did SPEAKER_00: It's that we're allowing some cell pressure to happen so that there's not just one giant Ian: Exactly. Ian: Don't. Ian: Moment. Justin Waldron: Yeah. Ian: Yeah. Ian: Yeah, so I think V is just going to need help Ian: i'm making a visual here that's easy to understand because half of this is the explanation the other half is Ian: mechanism. Ian: Yeah, I'm trying to think of... Ian: what promotions or what programs you know any Ian: anywhere in history, like in marketing, have had Justin Waldron: you know, dual win, dual win, uh, state, you know, Ian: Because I'm sure that somebody has solved this problem before. Ian: that says like, hey, you're vesting this over six, whatever it is, three months. Ian: and everybody's vesting it Ian: and then on the side say like Ian: at 5 million market cap and 10% of our stock market. Ian: And it doesn't need to be even attached to it. Ian: specific amount Ian: because you don't Ian: know you don't Ian: know when they're Ian: going to hit the Ian: milestone and the Ian: best thing could be Ian: happening linearly, could be happening daily, right? Ian: or like moment to moment, depending on what kind of vesting contract Ian: could just give them a percentage of the remaining supply of the Ian: unvested supply you're just you're just investing whatever so it's like this is 10 you're getting Ian: 10% of the invested supply. Ian: Got it. Ian: And that way, Ian: you can still split the rest within the same time frame. Ian: acceleration of the Ian: unvested portion and Ian: then whatever is left Ian: over is just now Ian: continuing to vest on the same time frame so you're not missing the time Ian: frame you're just pulling forward a chunk of it Ian: it if you Ian: get it at Ian: the end Ian: then it's Ian: a smaller Ian: chunk Ian: but you're Ian: you're on Ian: locking early but if you do it early you can get a bigger chunk and then a hundred percent is Ian: is the $100 million market cap milestone. Ian: You could even make the percentages tied to the market caps. Ian: They sort of kind of line up. Ian: 100% for $100 million, 50% for $50 million. Ian: That makes it very, very easy to understand. Ian: and more importantly, to memorize 50-50. Ian: 100-100. Done. Justin Waldron: Yeah. Ian: And then, yeah. Ian: Yeah, 25, maybe you make the milestones like, I don't know, 25 years. Ian: with the 7500 or something like that I don't think we need more kind of Justin Waldron: $25, $10, $25, $50. Ian: Yeah. Justin Waldron: Yeah. Justin Waldron: 10, 25, yes, exactly, I like that. Ian: And then there will always still be money that's going to be coming in through the rest Ian: I think that's really elegant. Ian: Yeah, it keeps a nice engagement mechanic. Ian: best of both worlds Ian: where the rewards Ian: are meaningful Ian: the best thing Ian: is there Ian: and Ian: There's reasons to keep continuing to be coming back. Ian: Yeah, that could be pretty good. Ian: Yeah. Ian: This way. Ian: I think so. Ian: Nice. I'll walk V through it. Justin Waldron: I spent some time with him this morning. Justin Waldron: I don't know if he reached out just because like if it was too late for him Justin Waldron: but he was too curious, but he's like, what happened with Mark? Justin Waldron: I'm like, I have no idea what happened with Mark. Justin Waldron: But we spoke about vesting and gave him some feedback. Justin Waldron: we had not planned for, so I updated the spec Justin Waldron: stuff to show you while I'm sleeping, but yeah, I think we'll get Justin Waldron: some good stuff out of him. Ian: A lot of the UI stuff is basically done for him, Ian: This is kind of the only functional screen in the app that's not built. Ian: I walked through the initial version with him, what it could look like yesterday. Ian: hey there's like a progress bar and then people have to stay and the progress bar goes up and then Ian: there has to be a button for them to refer stakers so that's the other part of it you Ian: and i haven't covered that i think is important Ian: which is what we realized. Ian: So Scott has been doing all this legwork Ian: the BD side with all these token teams and we're running into whales who have large supplies Ian: token, but don't have socials. Ian: And then we have traders. Ian: who can pump the token, but don't, you know, but meanwhile, Ian: with maybe using their socials and their influence. Ian: And then we have people who are like key people Ian: in the community Ian: who have a lot of influence Ian: but in some cases Ian: literally have zero token. Ian: For instance, Ian: like the guy Ian: that runs the peanut account, Ian: which apparently is still like 200 million marketplace Ian: cop or something. He doesn't own any. And so, Ian: we've been originally talking to these people Ian: about like these one-off deals Ian: where we're like, oh, this guy gets 0.1%. Ian: But obviously, we're not going to really be able to cut Ian: like hundreds of deals with hundreds of people because that's how many people are involved. Ian: was trying to think how does this particular launch mechanism serve all of them and I think Ian: it basically can Ian: but we have to Ian: we have to add Ian: a referral switcher Ian: because Ian: If we add the referrals feature, then the guy who runs the peanut Ian: account Ian: can really Ian: move people Ian: or the Ian: telegram group Ian: chat can Ian: can use his Ian: influence in the peanut community to get his bag of this toy. Ian: Yeah. Ian: And then you're good because you can cover everybody. Ian: the traders, they'll be part of the crew that launches and snipes the bonding curve and shills Ian: it as the price goes up. The people who run the socials will use the referral links to Ian: to get some of the free 20% and then the people who are whales will will Ian: come in to be the people who get to the 5% threshold to launch the coin. Ian: you get, you get it all in one mechanism and then we don't need to do individual, um, Ian: negotiations with every single person we just based on what people bring to the table they can they can Ian: can all get exposure. Ian: through one uniform system so now the question is like how do the referrals reward you Ian: out of that 20% the UI is pretty simple like we just have two buttons Ian: It's like stake your trunk to launch or refer stuff. Ian: Trump stakers yeah and and that's it and then referring Trump stakers it's you get Ian: little box and then you copy your link and you send it to people and then if those people stay and you're not Ian: You're not getting credit for the amount of people who stake. Ian: You're getting credit based on the number of tokens they stake. Ian: if you capture a whale you're getting a huge reward yeah the problem is it Ian: can't be a Ian: percentage of Ian: what they Ian: they did Ian: because then Ian: if you Ian: You gave them 10% or for 10% of whatever the stakeholders brought in. Ian: It might mean more than we can afford. Ian: Yeah. Ian: Well, so we have this 20% pool. Ian: And so I thought about this a little bit yesterday. Ian: If you make a separate pool for refers, you run into a separate problem. Ian: which is you create a new type of scam, not a scam, Ian: just people Ian: gaming the system Ian: where Ian: say we had Ian: they would basically Ian: ad refer refers where there was no refer and they would just send the extra referral to their Ian: other wallet because it would it would be a way of double dipping mm-hmm Ian: So you can't have a separate pool for referrer rewards, um, or, or SPEAKER_00: people who aren't even referred will be just referring, putting in their own referral codes SPEAKER_00: to get free referrals. Ian: referral tokens so it'll be a messed up system you can't use Ian: give them 10% credit of what someone brings in because then people Ian: remove the Ian: referrer code Ian: because they're Ian: not going to Ian: want to give Ian: up the 10% Ian: tax so Ian: So the only way you can make people leave in the referrer codes is if Ian: everyone is kind of taxed equally, right? Where we're basically Ian: Basically, we don't know how much of the supply is going to go to the referrer. Ian: but we keep track of how much support SPEAKER_00: supply or what percent of the tokens each refer brought in. Ian: And then at the end, it inflates everybody. Ian: or it inflates everybody equally. Ian: I can see that, yeah. Ian: then there's no incentive Ian: for like a whale to say Ian: I'm getting rid of this because it's taking 10% from me, because it wouldn't be taking 10% from Ian: you like if a bunch of whales came in if more and a half percent came out Ian: in without refers none of that has a anything attached to it and then if i came in with a 0.5 Ian: Maybe this guy is earning 0.1%. Ian: or 10% of 0.5, so 0.05% or something. Ian: but Ian: but it's Ian: distributed across Ian: like everybody Ian: so Ian: So it's not like just the person that you brought in is getting 10% hit. Justin Waldron: Does that make sense? Ian: I feel like I'm describing it in a more complicated way. Ian: Yeah, I didn't get it. Can you, you know, let me try again? Ian: So there can't be a separate referrer pool because then it opens a system to being gamed Ian: a bunch of people Ian: adding fake referrers Ian: when they weren't referred Ian: to double dip Ian: and there can't be Ian: attacks directly on the people that were referred because they'll want to remove the thing to not get the pepper Ian: tax. Ian: The only solution to that would be to make it so low that then the referrers wouldn't Ian: So if you want to richly reward the referrers, but... Ian: then I think you have to equally tax everybody from Ian: pool with the credit that was given. So you want, you need to, one, Ian: One, it has to be based on the amount Ian: that the person they brought in quit in. Ian: But you track how much they brought in Ian: And then at the end, Ian: You calculate that amongst all the other holdings somehow. Ian: somehow. Ian: If there were no refers, then it's just a pro rata distribution. Ian: of everybody's, one second, there's another one. Ian: I just want to make sure that everybody else is able to run it without me. Justin Waldron: Okay. Justin Waldron: Okay. Justin Waldron: Okay. Justin Waldron: Okay. Ian: Okay. Ian: So imagine like we have this pool and there's Ian: There's up to 5% of tokens that get contributed to be the launchers or whatever, right? Ian: The simplest thing, if there were no referrers, you would just take their pro rata Ian: amount of tokens they contributed and then that would be their parada share of the 20 right yep Ian: now if there are refers you don't know Ian: how many of them are going to include refers, some of the supply will include refers and some of them won't. Ian: So the simplest thing to do is just track what each refers Ian: share of tokens was. Ian: so Ian: if I referred 1% of the tokens Ian: are 1% of the 5%. Ian: Yep. Ian: And you just track that. Ian: And then it's... Ian: the end you see what is the total amount of tokens oh it's five percent and what is the total Ian: amount of Ian: referred tokens Ian: and then you Ian: have a formula Ian: to decide Ian: how much of the 20% goes to the refers and that pool can grow our Ian: would grow, it wouldn't be constant, it wouldn't be like 5% of the 20%. Ian: goes to Ian: refers every Ian: time so Ian: some guy Ian: who referred Ian: a very Ian: small amount Ian: because no Ian: one else Ian: referred any Ian: got a massive part of the 20% that wouldn't really make any sense Ian: Um, it's, it's like you could end up in a situation where nobody referred anybody and Ian: was no refers portion of the 20% or everything was referred and the referred part Ian: ends up being up to 10% of the 20%, not 10%. Ian: 10 points, but up to Ian: 2 of the 20%, Ian: if that makes sense. Ian: I think so. Ian: So the math for that would be like... Ian: It dilutes everybody equally. Ian: is what I mean. Ian: So, like, if... Justin Waldron: Yeah, the question is how do you communicate in such a way that Justin Waldron: Because users come out ahead if you do the math and you think about it. Justin Waldron: The initial reaction is the selfish one, it's like whoa, whoa, whoa. Justin Waldron: the real challenge taking taking stuff from the people who Ian: who staked? Ian: Yeah. Ian: Like that message of everybody Ian: gets diluted it's like how do you communicate? I don't think that's part of the message so I think what Ian: you say is that Ian: so what we Ian: have in the Ian: UI is Ian: stakers and Ian: referrers get Ian: part of this 20% launcher pool Ian: and they're sharing it. Ian: and you just say Ian: hey like stakers Ian: and refer to share it Ian: and then you have Ian: everybody stake Ian: and you have her Ian: everybody try to refer, and then at the end, we run this math and we tell everybody what Ian: That's true. Ian: That's, Ian: I think that's all there is to it. Ian: And I don't think we need to be like super transparent. Ian: just figure out Ian: exactly what the Ian: math is before Ian: I probably have to Ian: jump to this other Ian: call because I'm Ian: not sure if Ian: stock can Justin Waldron: and that'll give me time to also maybe do some thinking and some numbers. Ian: Yeah, one second. Justin Waldron: Oh, although I did want to ask one thing. Justin Waldron: before you leave let me let's make sure I check it Ian: Launch a pool with Senti Dracomani State. Justin Waldron: Yeah. Ian: Yeah, and only first order. Ian: So, yeah, so this is, in other words, percent claim is token C. Ian: I think this is... Ian: You can look at the math and see. Justin Waldron: Yeah, okay. Ian: this is Ian: I'll figure Ian: it out Ian: I'm sure Ian: I'll double Ian: check Ian: I think this Ian: by the total staked and the total referred times 0.1. Ian: That's the total sort of pool. Ian: So what percentage did they contribute? Ian: And then for them, we just say, hey, stakers and referrers get rewarded as part of the Ian: both launchers. Ian: Yeah. Ian: And I don't think we need to tell them this 0.1% part. Ian: I think so. I think you're right. Ian: It's just this is what's going to happen. SPEAKER_00: I'm gonna jump over to this call, it's with PIT. SPEAKER_00: They're a big token, so we're trying to get them on board. Ian: Let me know if you got any use to do another thing. Ian: Oh, yeah, one question. Ian: Do you mind if I... Justin Waldron: takeoff early tomorrow I need to go to home despot for the sink and there's not gonna be Justin Waldron: any developer online in the afternoon anyway? Ian: Yeah, yeah, of course. Ian: Also, like, I mean, if there's any way Kyoko can help with, like, I don't know, handyman-type Ian: situation just like reach out to her and maybe she can help coordinate something. Justin Waldron: Oh, thank you for the offer. Justin Waldron: Cool. Ian: All right, yeah. Ian: Thanks for the heads up either way. Ian: Yeah, let me know on this one. Ian: And I just want to unblock me because Ian: Otherwise, he's just like working on socials and other stuff. Ian: He's kind of. Ian: I'll check in with him. Ian: Tonight is important. Justin Waldron: Cool. Ian: All right. Ian: All right. Ian: Thanks, Ian. Ian: See you."
