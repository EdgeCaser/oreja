# 📁 Old GUI Archive - CORRECTION

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This archive was created by mistake. The files that were moved here were actually the CORRECT GUI components.

## 🔄 **Files Moved Back:**

### `speaker_analytics_gui.py` - ✅ RESTORED
- This was the **CORRECT** speaker analytics GUI 
- **Status:** Moved back to `backend/` directory
- **This is the GUI you should be using**

### `start_analytics.py` - ✅ RESTORED
- This was the **CORRECT** launcher script
- **Status:** Moved back to `backend/` directory  
- **Launcher correctly updated to use this script**

## ✅ **Current Correct Setup:**

**The proper GUI system:**
- **GUI:** `backend/speaker_analytics_gui.py` (Python tkinter interface)
- **Launcher:** `backend/start_analytics.py` 
- **Main Launcher:** `launch_oreja_analytics.py` (now calls correct script)

## 🗑️ **This Archive Folder:**

This folder can now be deleted as it was created in error. The C# application (`publish/Oreja.exe`) may be a test version or older version - the Python GUI was the correct modern interface.

**Last updated:** June 3, 2025 - **CORRECTED**
